Update: 6/10/17.
Added pivtures with new cover and glass protector. So far phone still works as expected. THinking
Of adding another star.",Positif
"The phone looks as advertised and come with a charger (110V), a key to open the slots and headphones.

HOWEVER, within a few days of using it, the screen has started freezing when tapping on it. It started with the camera app while taking phones. You keep touching the screen but the phone does not respond. Sometimes it takes more than a minute and I have to close the camera and reopen it. It has now started happening in other apps. I find this very strange since I have had the phone about 2 weeks now if so much...

It uses the micro sim cards and has two slots and a space for adding more storage space. The photo quality is very good, both front and back and it has a built in flashlight app. A+ for me. One less app to download.

Feel free to ask me any questions... I'm considering returning it for a replacement however.",Positif
"My review is not based on incidents that I could have corrected. If I could have corrected it I would have rated it higher. Nor is based on shipping or postal defects such as a cracked screen or anything like that. It is neither based on me expecting this device to be exceptional above all else. It is purely factual in every regard. Okay let me start off by saying: the product came as displayed. So that's a pro.

Con's
1. I think there were some glitches with the programming because the left side of the screen kept doing it's own thing. Like if I'm typing. The left side would start selecting random letters and all sort of things.
Still on glitches the screen would stop working and start showing black and white. So I had to turn off the screen and turn it on back.
The keyboard would stop working also. Like I would be typing then the keys would stop pressing and the keyboard would be minimized. Like?? no.
2. The fingerprint sensor did not work like how it should have. I had to set my hand vertically on the sensor. It did not work if I had my finger horizontally (parallel to the phone screen).
3. The brightness control did not work. My phone was stuck in the brightest level. Even when the phone was in macimum power save mode. It did not work. Which defeated the purpose.
4. I had to download the basic Samsung Applications my self.
5. The operating system looked like that of the older samsung models (like my old S4) which was a bummer.

I had to pay for someone to fix all of these issues. (I tried factory resetting and that didn't work)",Negatif
"(THIS IS A SAMSUNG J7 PRIME 2017. BY SAMSUNG. THIS WILL *NOT* WORK WITH CERTAIN CELLPHONE CASES THAT SAY 2015. THERE NEEDS TO BE CLEARER DESCRIPTIONS FOR THIS AD INDICATING WHICH CASES IT WILL AND WONT WORK WITH. PUTTING WHAT YEAR THIS CELL PHONE IS, WOULD BE A GREAT START FOLKS.)

I am upgrading from a junk Kyocera hydro phone I bought on clearance from Walmart two years ago, on Black Friday.

Right away, from the getgo, this phone is amazing, Long battery life, super fast cellphone cpu, a lot of memory, and no lag or response times so far. It responds quickly, no freeze screens, power on / off / restart works fine, and I even put in a 16 gb micro sd card from my Kyocera that it recognized right away. It is also unlocked, which is nice too. I plan on traveling with it and getting a sim card from ATT up north without having to worry if it will be able to be used by that carrier or not.

If youre looking for an upgrade and having phone frustrations with an older android phone, don't hesitate, don't be the old me, upgrade. get this phone.
I stuck with a junker phone for a year and a half, hoping my phone would get better if i kept cleaning it off. All I was doing was delaying the inevitable. This Samsung J7 Prime phone is durable [Frame made out of METAL], sturdy, and amazing. and as a guy with really, big hands and not very dexterous, this phone is very easy to use for people like me. As my huge fingers and hands hit the wrong keys frequently on other phones and apps on them. This phone also comes with a 1 year warranty on select parts in the phone for manufacturer defects (6 months on certain parts from manufacturer defects also, read the manual.)
......ps (Just don't drop it....... unless you have insurance through squaretrade)

Google Apps with Android, has a cloud (storage) service. I was able to take all of the useful/borderline necessary apps/save data/etc off my old Kyocera phone, put them on the cloud, and move them over to this phone (samsung j7 prime). It took a bit of time to figure my way around, but I did it.

Cons: The only annoying part of this phone, is that to get the sim card doors open (*there are two doors. one door holds just a sim card. the other one, holds a sim card, and a micro sd card*), you have to use the tool provided. It looks like something wal mart would stick in your items in the packages, to keep you from walking out the store without paying.
Now, how samsung expects us to lug this around in my pocket without bending, breaking, or losing the flimsy thing is beyond me. But in all their wisdom, they made the doors like this. They're not the kind on some phones you'd expect where you stick your fingernail in and pop the door out. thats the only major inconvenience, right off the bat, i see with this phone. For that, I will give this review a 4 star review.

this review was made on 11/17/2017 and I will update through constant use any flaws or defects if I find any.",Positif
Great phone works well in Babados. I strongly recommend this phone to anyone purchasing a phone to use in the Caribbean,Positif
"Works great! No problems with phone. International version doesn't display 4G ... However, it does display H+ which is equivalent to 4G.",Positif
"The phone itself works normally but the reason im giving it 4 stars is because the description says itz 4g LTE compatible, i live in the U.S. and took it to different places trying to activate the 4g lte option on the phone, but the phone itself doesn't have the 4g LTE option. I've seen reviews from people from other countries and they say it works perfectly fine for them , so my advice is if you live in the U.S. and want 4g LTE dont buy it , its not worth the trouble. And i gave it four stars because i asked to return the item the process was smooth and simple even though they didn't refund the total price i payed including shipping and handling it was still good knowing i could get some of my money back.(update) i received the full refund including the shipping ans handling.",Positif
"I upgraded from my LG G3 Stylus D690 which after 2 years of use was freezing all the time and processing very slow even though I constantly cleaned unnecessary files, etc.

Determined to have a new unlocked phone with larger processor, more internal memory and dual SIM with a budget of $200 or less; I found this one at $239 with everything I was looking for>>>32 Gb memory, Octa-core processor and descent camera (8 megapixel front facing & 13 back facing).

So far, after more than a month's constant usage, it has been running LIGHTNING FAST & PURRRFECTLY!!

I am so happy with this purchase...What's more, I didn't have to pay for it, my boyfriend did as a birthday gift!! Even if I had, I'd consider this a great buy!!

Love the pink gold color back and the fact that it is all metal body, Corning glass screen and very sturdy...have actually dropped it a few times (in its wallet case) and produced no cracks, scratches or dents!

I wish I could add photos, but at this time I have no other available camera besides the one on the phone, itself! However, it looks just like the photos provided in descriptions!",Positif
"I was nervous about paying this much for a phone. In general, I'm a $20 phone girl. I don't need a phone with a ton of space or the best camera, I just need a phone that sends texts, makes calls and has enough room for an app or two. But, this was an anniversary gift from my husband and he really wanted me to have a ""good"" phone. I've had it for a few months now and I'm as happy as can be with it. I haven't taken many photos, but the ones I have taken are lovely. It runs all the apps my old phone did, and many more, with room to spare. I haven't had any issues with it at all.",Positif
"This phone was advertised as UNLOCKED. However, we had to seek assistance from our carrier to set it up. Our carrier advised us that it was NOT UNLOCKED and that is the reason we could not complete the set up process - the phone cannot be used with any carrier.

Amazon tech support could not assist and this Christmas present must be returned and a different phone must be purchased. EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT!",Negatif
"Returning, LTE does not work on metro pcs/t-mobile network. Should have been stated in listing that it will not work in U.S. Waste of time.",Negatif
"This phone has frequency which doesn't detect Tmobile network. I spoke with tmobile we were trying to set the configuration this phone but phone has not internet and very bad service.

My oldest phone works great on tmobile network with 4G LTE internet and amazing service, and I don't know why this phone does't want to detect the service even i spoke with t-mobile technicians for than 2 hours. we did the configuration many times but not internet not service.

We tried even AT&T and doesn’t work at all.

Don’t buy this phone and shame on Amazon which allows this kids of phones to be sold on amazon.com

I like the phone but it seems it doesn't work in the USA or at least on tmobile.",Negatif
"Worst product ever, Shame on you Amazon..Phone wouldn't connect to AT&T network. Useless phone..Not for use in the U.S..Maybe India..DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER...",Negatif
"I am SO happy I found this phone on here instead of buying the regular J7 that was offered to me by the T-Mobile representative.
Worth far more than the price. Excellent for an Android phone, far better for an affordable galaxy.
ESPECIALLY for the 32 gb offered for this phone right here on Amazon. I hardly ever have to worry about storage. It rarely misbehaves. Excellent picture quality. Very fast and reliable. I have T-Mobile for my service and heard Galaxy phones are better with T-Mobile. Since I had my SIM card on a Motorola I couldn't even access my data, I could only make calls. Finding the J7 Prime was a game changer for me. If you never had a galaxy but want one and don't want to shell out hundreds of dollars, just invest in this one!

The ONLY thing I can say I don't like about this phone, it's not NFC compatible. So you can't use this phone to pay at stores or automatically scan your card at banks. That's really the only draw back.

Do yourself a favor save your money, you don't NEED the newest Samsung Galaxy phone. Just invest in this one.",Positif
"Check the specs on the phone carefully when you recieve it . I ordered a 32GB , the box said 32GB but the phone itself is saying 16gb.",Negatif
Better than expected... No envy to those of higher range for a reasonable price...Very good product,Positif
I love my new phone. The camera is not what I excepted. It could be better.,Positif
The phone is beautiful but its not compatible with T-Mobile I tried all different ways I took it to the T-Mobile store to see and it's just not compatible with T-Mobile .. I had no problems returning it and they gave me my refund right away ...,Negatif
"I recently bought this phone and have been adjusting to going from an iphone back to an Android. I used Androids for years and have always liked them better; however, the internet connection keeps timing out on this phone. It has nothing to do with my Internet connection/modem/rounter/etc, because my laptop works perfectly fine while this phone keeps timing out. If I search the internet it spins and spins/loads and loads and then times out. Very unhappy about not being able to use the Internet on this phone. Otherwise, happy with the phone. Buyers beware.",Positif
"Two-plus months into my J7 and no complaints. Granted, I'm no phonephile, but for my basic phone, text and Internet usage it's been a great phone. Why exactly do people spend $600-$700 dollars for a phone?",Positif
"Purchased for my fiancé in India to use (has all frequency bands required by Reliance JIO), shipping was quick, product arrived in great quality and for some strange reason a USA style charging plug, yet the phone itself defaulted to Telugu for its language, which made initial setup a bit confusing, after changing it to English and removing the app that comes only in Telugu it was ready to go for normal usage. Great features for a budget phone, a tiny bit larger than my Galaxy S6 and similarly fast. Side note: Shipping this to India via FedEx cost almost as much as the device alone did, $111 for shipping and then $60 more for customs on delivery.",Positif
"The Phone was intended to use in Pakistan (as an Unlocked Phone) and its running good there. The phone displayed 64 GB memory on box and a confusing statement which let me believe that a (free) SD card will be along it (reason I am subtracting one star) performance, display and camera are good.",Positif
AdwAdvertise for 32GB only has 16,Negatif
"Love this J7 Prime phone. It's just the right size. Screen is large but not too large that it makes the whole phone seem bulky in a pocket. The screen is also very bright and easy to read. I got it in the white/gold, and the overall look is fresh, clean and modern. I bought it ""used - like new"" for a great price from Gotham's Cells. It came looking like new, working perfectly, and the battery life is great. So happy I decided to buy used. But a word of caution if you buy used or from a third-party marketplace seller: Make sure you check the ratings of the seller very carefully before buying. Gotham's Cells had the highest rating of all the sellers on this product page (it was 97% when I bought) so I was pretty confident their ""used"" phone would be in the condition they said it was in.

This is my first Samsung phone, but it won't be my last.",Positif
This battery lasts a long time! I love that about this phone. I only need to charge it every two days or so. And I don't underuse my phone. Lots of internet surfing and texting. However the camera isn't great. I'm low light the camera is super grainy. So if you want a good camera in your phone I would probably keep looking. The speakers could also be better. I have a tough time with speaker phone being loud enough.,Positif
"The service sent on time, phone box was covered safety especially the phone has already have screen protector .The phone is okay for a try and price. I am using iphone 6. In my overview: phone shape is same same iphone 8, quite nice and light. Picture is bright but not sharp color. Battery is not last long as said (only 6 hrs to watch on YouTube), also charging took so long for full- over 2hrs for a first charge. The second time is shorter a bit, maybe by using another cord not from Samsung device.",Positif
"This phone is a brick with T-Mobile. Nice rep in the T-Mobile store tried everything. Another 2 another got involved. After 2 hours, nothing except 2G which is being phased out (and already gone in this part of the world). New shift came in and a third rep came in and said, ""That is a parallel imported phone. I have been seeing a lot of them lately and none of them work."" Be warned!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR T-MOBILE!",Negatif
"The phone is nice,works well .my only dissatisfaction is I thought it was wider in width.the length is good but for a 5.7 as advertised,it's not as wide as I expected.",Positif
"The phone was great when I first got it. There was no lag, no failure whatsoever, everything ran smoothly and the overall feel of the phone was great. The quality of the camera wasn't too bad either. I could even do a lot on that phone as the battery would last for a good 6 hours of constant use. I have had this phone for a little over a year now and it never glitched out or anything. Occasionally it would turn off and on again but I thought it was because of how many things I had downloaded on it (but it definitely wasn't 32GB worth of stuff).

However, it has officially factory reset BY ITSELF!!!!
Not once, not twice, but continuously!! I can't do anything on it because it'll just reset again.

All my pictures and even contact numbers & info are all gone. There's no way to get them back because I can't even access the phone itself. I can redownload the apps, but everything else is gone, no getting them back. I have tried everything, even contacting a friend who's an expert and even HE couldn't fix it! But honestly, what do you expect from a cheap phone? Will definitely NOT recommend unless you know it will be extremely temporary.

p.s. I would post pictures but I don't have a phone to take them with.",Negatif
"Its great phone but i returned it!!!
Reason
Battery looks like not replacable. So when battery dies phone become useless.
If manyfacturer gives 5 yr warranty for battery ivwill surely buy again and give 5 stars",Positif
"This phone does not work on 4g LTE in the U.S.
Yes, the phone does function, however, if you plan on using internet... Be prepared for very slow loading! This was not specified anywhere in the product description/specs. I have sent this product back for a refund. Great phone that was falsely advertised to be capable of doing something it cannot.",Negatif
Had to return the phone. Did not realize it was an international phone. I wish the language had been clearer and that I did not have to dig to find it out after the fact. Thanks anyways.,Negatif
"I bought my wife the Samsung J7 Prime. She loves it. It works very well and very smoothly. So, after seeing her phone, I bought a second one just like it. I, too, am enjoying the phone. Everything works on it. It has plenty of speed and memory to do whatever we need it to do.
The phone arrived quickly and in great condition.",Positif
"Label on box and on phone says 32gb but phone system has only 16gb.

Update:
I yr later and regretting the decision I took to remain with this phone. When I received I checked the packaging and it read 32gb, even labeled to the back of the phone, but I didn't set up my new phone till a few days later when I returned to my country from vacation. Whilst Amazon staff did everything in their power to rectify the situation my alternative as I was based out of USA was limited. Being compensated does not change the capabilities of the phone. I use minimal apps, very little social media and I'm out of storage!!! I can't even download apps for the most important thing in my life Travelling!!! Whilst I was granted compensation to acquire SD cards from Amazon i can only save pictures videos documents etc which I really don't keep on my phone. Apps can't be downloaded to SD cards. Again Amazon really went beyond to assist but up to now there hasn't been not even one bit of communication from the seller regarding this issue. Be very careful and check immediately when using this seller or but from alternative seller if possible.",Negatif
"The phone is great....I specifically ordered a Samsung because the previous two I owned had ""Wi-Fi"" calling capability. This one does not. If it did, it would get 5 stars.",Positif
"The seller was great. The phones reception is half that of my galaxy S4, S6, or S7. I'm with T mobile and that might have something to do with it. I have a friend with the single sim T mobile J7 Prime that has much better reception.",Positif
"It was a gift, and was well liked",Positif
"Thought it would be okay since it was fulfilled by Amazon. But:
- the box it came from was tampered with. There were two seals and both where cut out (see image). The top seal was wrinkled irregularly and the lower, hidden one was cut out cleanly with hand cutter.
- the device is already rooted! Even if I factory-reset it two times. See attached image: S-Health app refuses to start. Message translates to ""It's not possible to open the application"" ""Due to a new security policy, Samsung Health cannot be opened on a rooted device (0x110010null5e2830)""

Dissapointed with Amazon allowing either of those to happen. I bought it while visiting the US, cannot go back there just to return the device.
At least the IMEI codes are not blacklisted or reported as stolen. Hope it is really a new device and no one suffered being stolen.",Negatif
"First of all Amazon prime said I would get the phone in 2 days instead it took 6 days to arrive. I waited patiently without a phone in anticipation that it would be worth the wait.
I have had the phone for two days, it looks an feels beautiful, I have been able to make calls, it has all kinds of applications that looks promising. The problem I have is that there is no 4 g. The description said it had 4 g in the US but I have only been getting an E which is 2.5 g according to my research.
I have not been able to load any App except for WhatsApp. I can't get on to YouTube, or Microsoft, Facebook, etc. I a so disappointed. It may be because I do not live in the city, but I have never had this issue before. I hope it can be resolved if not I will have to return the phone.
I tried to contact the seller before doing a review but I did not see that option.",Negatif
"I love this phone, bought it in May but know it just stopped working after 5 months, I went to reset the battery except you have no battery door to open. Checked on the warranty, expired after 1 month, Hmm, not good, Will send email to samsung for further assistance, Will update soon.",Positif
I cannot rate something I did not get. I received scuba gear instead of a cell phone. If I could give it zero stars I would.,Negatif
"I bought this phone for my brother as a gift and surprised him, as he held the phone he said thanks, and was very excited happy. I let a week pass and asked him how did he like the phone, he said it looks and handle great he's in love I even buy him a case",Positif
This phone says on the page it works with T-Mobile and it does not. I can't even make a phone call. Will be returning.,Negatif
"I purchased this phone as a replacement for my stolen Samsung S5 Mini that was in great condition and did all that I wanted it to do. I read the reviews especially the critical ones and was was a bit nervy if I had made the right choice. I made the right choice. It came well packaged although I noted that there was a broken seal that was pasted over by an unbroken seal. Strange, but all the items in the package was well put together and the phone looked new in a Samsung Box and all. I love the weight of the phone. It feels that something is in my hand. It was easy to set up, absolutely no difficulties. The instructions were clear. The performance so far is just as I expected. The dual sim works like a charm. I had to have one of my sim cards cut to nano sim size; but the other provider supplies sim cards that are perforated to standard, mini and nano. The cutting was hassle free. If one has a difficulty in their country the sim cutter can be cheaply purchased online. I am very happy with the 32G and the white gold that I purchased. So far a solid purchase and I have no complaints whatsoever. I don't want this stolen so I will keep it close to my chest. I recommend it.",Positif
Wasn't a j7 prime when I checked imei...it was Samsung On7.... I find this to be deceptive.,Negatif
To start with I am not someone that writes reviews even when I'm unhappy with a product. However in this instance I felt it necessary to write a review. I was horribly disappointed with this phone. After 5 days of use the phone stopped working. I couldn't get pass the start screen which kept telling me there was a binary software issue which kept me locked out. I called Samsung and after several attempts at restarting the phone they were unsuccessful and stated I could send the phone back for repair not replacement. I don't feel that for a phone being used for 5 days I should have to have it repaired. I called Amazon for a replacement who stated they were out of stock and are unable to replace however I will be refunded the cost of the phone. I would never recommend to phone to anyone.,Negatif
I love Samsung! I needed an unlocked phone and this fits the bill. I like that it holds 2 sim cards. Great for traveling and no worries about losing the second on since it can be carried inside the phone even when set not to use it. It felt big at first but now I am getting used to it. I am having trouble finding a case that fits.,Positif
This phone front camera doesn't have a flash. Totally misleading description. The Samsung J5 does. You can turn on the light and take pictures at night and it shows bright as day. The Samsung J7 Prime is awful and picture quality extremely poor. All the screen does is go bright then you see the picture,Negatif
"The phone came in Arabic. I took it to the Samsung repair and they worked on it. It is now in English but the temperature still comes in in celsius instead of fahrenheit and any promotions still come in in Arabic. I wish I had known this prior to purchase. I need to go back to Samsung and get it reprogrammed again. The phone itself, I like, it is easy to use and much nicer than my previous phone.",Positif
"I moved my existing T-mobile Sim card from a Galaxy S5 and used it in my new J7. Although the T-Mobile service is functional on the J7 it was as edge speeds (super slow). Turns out that the phone does not support T-Mobile LTe bands (2, 4, 12, 66, 71) and uses different frequencies. The T-Mobile rep indicated that the phone is a consumer cellular phone and not designed for T-Mobile at full speed. Therefore, I am returning it for a compatible model.",Positif
Phone never had the ability to work here in the USA as it is not a 4G compatible phone. Decided to use the phone for games and the phone is already completely burnt out and useless. Waste of over $200. And of course this happened only 2 weeks after the time to be able to return it to Gotham. Never again will I buy any electronic device from them. I am also surprised that Amazon would allow such a shady company to sell through them. Buyer beware!!!,Negatif
Excellent choice. I love this phone. Display is bright. Icons are larger . Everything about this phone surpasses the Samsung S6 I previously had.,Positif
"Got as a Christmas present for my tween daughter. she loves it so far. it is in great working condition and we have had no problems other than finding a case that fits it. this is the 2016 year J7 Prime, international. that makes a difference when looking at cases as most of the time the button holes do not line up. after the 4th case we found one. be sure to read the fine print when looking at cases. otherwise the phone is great.",Positif
"Great buy for the cost. I would definitely recommend, currently using my phone in Jamaica.",Positif
"After spending hours transferring everything from my S6, not only did it NOT allow AOL emails but the phone (apparently made in India) died the very next day.
Samsung wanted me to visit their repair place LOCATED IN MID USA whereas I reside in NYC
with a MINIMUM Cost of $60 just to check it out.",Negatif
"Uodate: I've only had this phone almost 4 month's and it's barely usable now. Screen easily cracked, phone coloring and apps malfunctioning...I'm so upset I spent more than usual on a phone expecting better and yet I end up with worse...not worth the money

love the phone, everything about it really my only complaint is my screen broke on day 3 of having the phone. But it's fast..plenty of storage, easy to use, rarely any glitches, battery last very long..I charge this sometimes every other day",Negatif
"Very good phone, but it unfortunately comes loaded with tracking programs that unnecessarily use up memory and are intended to track your phone use. I asked the technician at the Samsung store to remove these programs. The phone works well.",Positif
"When I first got this phone, I used it as a mini-tablet for a while with no SIM card in it. A couple months later, it began to be unresponsive (screen would go black, would not respond to attempts to turn the screen back on or access any apps) and I had to reset it to factory settings. Once I reset the phone, I made sure to add my antivirus and VPN AGAIN first before I did anything else. That seemed to work, so I added my SIM and SD cards. BIG MISTAKE. Less than 48 hours later, it exhibited the same unresponsive behavior. I had to take my SIM and SD out and put it back in my old phone. $200 down the toilet.",Negatif
"Battery life was terrible. Drained from 35% to 0 in 3 hours with very little use despite being recommended as having the longest standby time available for a reasonable priced phone. Setup was awful and some apps stayed in foreign languages even after changing to English. Very disappointed and will be returning.

Also, the case and screen protectors Amazon recommended.....don't work together. Go figure.",Negatif

"This phone has a great feel to it with the brushed aluminum case. It looks expensive. The set up was effortless, all my photos,apps, and contacts transferred in minutes. The sound quality is great through the earpiece, speaker, and with headphones. With the few opportunities to take photos, it's been fine.
My best phone so far.",Positif

"Great product with features as expected. No problems experienced so far. Loving the memory and dual SIM. Comes unlocked in fresh box. Camera is okay, 13mp but looks as good as 16mp either way. White gold is beautiful and the phone is pretty cheap for the value which is rewarded. Great buy. :D",Positif
This product does NOT work with T-Mobile 4G LTE as stated in product description. Phone was manufactured in Thailand and ONLY support 2G/E connections. I went through several troubleshooting with T-Mobile & Samsung and still could not get this phone to work on 4G/LTE network.,Negatif

"Phone doesn't work well, I'm constantly switching between bands to get calls or messages. If I don't I miss many calls and messages.Also phone is fragile as soon as it knocks a piece chips off. Camera quality is a bit ok could be a lot better for a j7 prime 2018 phone. Takes a while to charge but holds charge for a good amount of time.phone is suddenly sticking and giving me the black screen of death and i had to soft reset to get it bk after hours of trying.",Positif
"One of the better dual SIM phones on the market, aside for the new dual SIM iPhone, and it has good results. However, it is hard to find a good working phone case as almost no case that claims to be compatible actually fits. Buttons are off, holes are off center or covered completely etc. It's also an older phone now and has some connectivity issues.",Positif
"Received the phone in good shape and quickly. But buried in the last bullet of the description is ""No U.S. warranty"". The phone's warranty is good only in the country of origin. After 6 months my phone no longer holds a charge. I'm told it's country of origin is Thailand. So unless I plan a trip to Thailand or, presumably, make arrangements to ship my phone to Thailand, I know have a lightweight brick.",Negatif
"Not fully compatible with ATT network.Not able to do wifi calling, or connect via 3 or 4 G in spite of repeated attempts by tech support to make it work. Forced to replace with ATT branded phone to get all features.",Negatif

"This is a european phone, and does not work correctly in the US. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE IN THE USA.",Negatif
"I took this phone the same week I received it out of the country and when I turned it on it’s asking for a pin. I didn’t create a pon for the phone, I don’t even sign in to google because I bought the phone for someone. Now I had to come back to the country and I left the phone hoping that they could unlock and they still can’t figure out why it’s locked.",Negatif

I waisted my money buying this phone I doesnt work with tmobile I cannot use my mobile data at all it doesn't have 4glte amazon should make sure that the phone description is right not wrong or fake.,Negatif

"When I received the phone, the phone was secure in a safeguarded box. The phone was in great new condition. A charger and headset are
included. After charging for a few minutes I was able to turn the phone on with a nice screen. The phone is great. I have not had any issues with it.
I am able to use this phone with cricket wireless which is an AT&T network. This is a nice upgrade to my LG phone. Now I see why everyone likes
Samsung.",Positif
"I dislike the fact that this phone is freezing and does not allow me to access any calls or applications. I am very disappointed about this purchase because I just bought it and I need to know if I could get a replacement or a reimbursement ASAP, and I'm all the way in Jamaica, hence it is difficult to return. The window for the complaint has closed, but never the less I need to know how am I going to be compensated?",Negatif
"This phone was a complete upgrade from what I had before. I was an old model that couldn't run apps on the Playstore. This phone was everything I wanted. It can run just about anything on the Playstore. I can game on it for a few hours without any overheating issues. Battery can use little to no energy when it in low power mode. High quality camera and sound. Screen size was bigger than expected. For the price, It is just amazing!",Positif
I am very angry right now as u can see i ordered a 32gb both the box n the sticker said 32gb however wen i checked the storage its 16gb this is a total disappointment and a rip off...i collected my package today and i am not please,Negatif
the battery runs down very quickly,Positif
"The phone I received appears to be new however, I believe that is NOT the case as the screen keeps jumping, the battery doesn't last at all and if that isn't bad enough the earphone insert doesn't work!!?? I'm pissed as hell!!",Negatif
"Original seal of box has been ripped and another printed duplicate seal has been put on the original. Ripped seal can be seen easily... I don’t know, what they are doing. Not sure, its a brand new phone.... something is wrong",Negatif
"The phone is good for ONE sim card. I have tried everything and the dual sim card simply does not work ""cannot register"". I have 2 AT&T nano sim cards and was looking for a one phone option... sadly with all of my basic knowledge and major research it does not appear to work in the USA. If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it :)",Negatif
this phone is a international phone and Samsung will tell you. you have to send it to Vietnam to get service TechnoMaster was no help I had to email them twice before I got a response. there response was to call Samsung. the phone was purchased in august of 2017 it will not charge or turn on I guess I am out over 200 bucks not a great deal!,Negatif
I wasn't able to use this Item with my cell phone carrier item was returned,Negatif
"This was a phone for a friend in El Salvador and it worked very good, no problem at all, the Sim worked with the carrier they have and all the apps were transferred without any issues. I recomend this cel phone.",Positif
"My son really wanted this phone and he enjoying himself to the max. The memory is superb, no more low memory messages and it automatically recovered all his contacts and photos from his Samsung account.",Positif
Main charger arrived separately which makes me second guess whether my instrument is brand new. Everything should have been boxed delivered together.,Positif
worst experience i can hear others but others can't hear my voice . changed 2 networks but still same issue. contacted samsung support but no use,Negatif
Lips to the phone and I'm sure that is is going to serve my needs will it's very complicated to me that you have to take in consideration that I'm 83 years old and a lot of new stuff I'm not adapt to but I seek help we have a Samsung team at Best Buy that has been a lifesaver and setting it up and the good thing about that they do not charge you anything for that I'm pleased with the phone,Positif
The phone in general works fine but I just can't understand why would they use that awful type of loudspeaker on it that's the only con I can think about for that price,Positif
"Great all-around phone for the price, the battery has lasted me up to two days, it's fast, the software is clean (no bloatware!) and customisable, and it's physical characteristics are excellent. It's pleasingly slim, and the screen is large enough for anything you need it for, the dual-sim feature is incredibly useful for me as I travel frequently. I love that I can easily manage which sim card is used for either texting, calling, or data right from the drop-down menu.
For me, the biggest caveat is the lack of compass. The phone is certainly usable for directions when driving because it uses the GPS to track the motion of the car to determine your direction of travel, but if you are trying use the phone for directions while on foot, the lack of compass stands out immediately. Neither the arrow nor the map rotate with the phone when on foot making it difficult to determine which way to start walking. After using this phone over the last year, I learned to use the landmarks noted on the map as reference points, but it would be much more user-friendly if there simply was a compass built into the phone.
Ultimately, I am very happy with this phone and would buy it again, but it could be even better if a compass was added.",Positif
1 bar with t-mobile when my note 5 has 5 bar with 4g lte. Not 4g lte compatible. Horrible Returned,Negatif

The looks and the performance of the product is exceptional to the extent that one day after I received it I gave it to my daughter and it caught the eye of someone while her bag and they stole it.

I purchased this cell phone white gold. I thought that it was USA version. The apps are displayed different from the regular Samsung galaxy J7 prime.

"Heats up very quickly.

Finding a protective case is a problem due to so many size changes on the J7 !!",Positif
"Issues:
It started in the wrong language.
There was no way to figure out how to put it in the correct language since I couldn't read the language it arrived in.
The AT&T card I had would not fit in it.
The additional memory would not fit either.

I tried to figure this out with Google but to no avail. Maybe they sent me the incorrect phone because it did not work with the network items from AT&T as it states it will in the description.

This phone is a cheap sad useless version of a real Galaxy 7. Do not be fooled. There is a reason it cost so much less than the the S7. Don't be fooled.",Negatif
Good phone. Doesn't support both carriers only one or the other.,Positif
I love this phone. Very happy i bought it.,Positif
Buggy as heck. Can't take the battery out to see if that would help. Would never get this model again.,Negatif
"The phone is slow, it's loosing the connection, it just doesn't work fine.

Everything else is good. Little hard to find the screen protector and the case. Always love Samsung.",Positif
"I've owned and used this phone for over a year now, and am loving it! It replaced my old iPhone and iPad, and even though I had to get used to it, I love it better than the iPhone (plus it's a lot cheaper and the screen size of it is perfect).

All in all the Phone's really good",Positif
"This phone was falsely described as working with the LTE/4G network. It does NOT. I took it to a carrier store to have it activated, and the guy said that this was a foreign phone and that any dual-SIM phone will be blocked from using U.S. carrier networks by the FCC. So this phone will not be able to get mobile data in the U.S., regardless of which carrier you use. This amounts to false advertising.",Negatif
Excellent product same as pictures. Very good functionality OK.,Positif

"Really nice phone, my mother is in loved with it!",Positif
This phone was going well until the screen died. No hope of having the screen replaced (way too expensive - $300+) and the phone was less than a year old. Could not find anyone who would honour the warranty even after getting advice from ACCC. Samsung Australia did not want to know! Totally disinterested. So would I every buy another mobile on-line. The short answer is NO.,Negatif
"I love it for now. However, I will need to give it time to see if it will still be functional or not over the next few months. So far its user friendly, no battery issues, you can download as many apps as you wish, the camera is ok. It does the job.",Positif
"Phone worked great for two minutes then crashed after recommended update.

Charger that came with phone was Europe model, does me no good.

Talked to Samsung. They said phone was tampered by the third party seller. No warranty, no additional help.

Never buy from this company! Terrible!",Negatif

"I was OK until phone was frozen after 8 months' usage. Since it is not an original US version, Samsung US doesn't support it. Seller already mentioned no warranty in US, so I won't blame the seller. I am not sure it was my bad luck or quality issue of Samsung phone...",Negatif

"I am very disappointed with this phone. I strongly believe that the seller sold me an old phone instead of the new one. About two months after i got the phone, the screen protector scratched even though i never put one. Adding to that it came already mounted. I was just excited of my new phone and did not wonder why it came mounted. Four months after the purchase the phone started shutting down on me. Just a nightmare. The first day it started the screen would not stay on for one second. I put on the charger and it took forever to charge and did loose power so fast afterward. I googled solutions online, then discovered that Samsung phones in general have battery issues. I found suggestions online to put it on power recovery mode and put the battery out for a couple of minutes. Unfortunately, nobody i asked help from could open the phone. Did they glue it before sending it to me? I watched the video online on how they opened other phone, but mine won't open. I put it on power saving mode but the screen is completely dark. In order to call, i have to tap the screen repeatedly; if not the screen will got off and interrupt the call. ans some calls are promptly interrupted. The seller gave me only a month of warranty. other sellers give 3 months or even a year. This people knew that they were selling me a bad product.
Shame on them for abusing their customer like that.",Negatif

* Battery (it lasts long periods).

The problem on it is that it misses some sensors needed for virtual reality (VT), like gyroscope and accelerometer. Most part of it's competitors (mobiles on the same level) has those sensors. But it's obvious that Samsung took it out just to sell S7 and it's proper glasses.",Positif

"Terrible, bought this phone for my girlfriend and it froze first 2 weeks of use, did a factory reset and it was fine for another week, afterwards I figured out that the screen went completely black when it reached 5 percent battery life, and finally the screen went completely black when the phone wasn't plugged in to the charger. 3 weeks of use and I can confidently say this was the worst experience of any phone I have purchased. I'm sure this has nothing to do with the phone line, just that the seller is giving a faulty product, as I have read that others have had similar experiences. Stay away from this product!!!!",Negatif
"Received phone April 6, missing sim tray, ordered new sin tray, took 6 weeks to arrive from china, the second phone line still doesn't work, took it to repair shop for analysis, they claim the sim reader part doesn't work and it is attached to motherboard. Now it is to late to return it. Not happy.",Negatif
This phone would get a full 5 stars if Amazon would be clearer in the description that is not intended for USA GSM use. I've purchased several unlocked international phones in the past and never had an issue with data not working after adjusting the apn and network modes for the area I'm in. This phone in the US will not work with anything other than H+ which depending on your carrier is usually a very slow 4G or 3G equivalent. The descriptions do not say anything about this phone not working with GSM high speed networks only that CDMA networks like Verizion and Sprint will not work. I will be contacting Amazon later today after I reactivate my old phone for a full refund and return. There should be an option to turn on the LTE bands on the US since it says in the specs that it is LTE compatible. I spent almost a full day messing with APN settings. My wife has the Samsung J7 710m and she gets full LTE and according the specs listed they both have the same LTE and 4G GSM compatibility bands. I even checked coverage maps with my carrier Net10. I'm a very frustrated customer and not at all happy.,Negatif

"This phone has perfect hardware features but you have to be an expert to analyze the bands where this phone works for LTE service. In my case, I tested the phone with AT&T sim in USA and it worked fine, but I returned to my country, Peru, and the service 4G LTE is not supported for this phone in the local bands, only I get 3G service. This is frustrating, there are cheaper models to have 3G service. I think the seller has to recommend to check if the phone will be compatible in other countries. I will try to return the phone to the seller.",Negatif

So far im in love with this phone ! I love the quality of the phone and the sleek metal body. I love the fact that the speaker is on the side of the phone and its loud! The only complaint is that this version of the j7 doesn't have the selfie flash option like the 2016 j7 has. Other then that it's amazing ! And regardless of the selfie flash the camera is amazing front and back:) highly recommend this phone if you'd like something updated but won't break the bank!!!,Positif
"This is a really nice phone. It is a 2017 version so the case and screen proctors i ordered for a 2016 will not fit.
Its a really great phone and i am so happy its a 2017 version. I have an S7 and wondered why i paid so much for it!
We are taking it to china for my Wife's parents. right out of the box selected Chinese for the language and downloaded all the aps she likes.
They a little older so we opted for the larger buttons and i am so jealous. Love the large screen and everything about it so far.
I will update this review when we return from our trip.
So we returned from china and the phones are great. The problem with the phone cases was solved. in china they are known as the ON7
so the case and screen protectors for the J7/ON7 Fit great.We purchased sim cards in china and everything works great.

At first glance upon receiving this phone it was very nicely packaged and the phone itself is amazing. I loved everything about the phone itself until i went and tried to activate it and found that the phone actually isn't unlocked and because the phone was from like Europe or something that I wouldn't be able to use it here in the US at all.

Then i have the luck of dropping the phone just getting out of my car, and now there's a huge crack in the phone.

"This phone is awesome. I've been using it for two weeks and it works really good.
? Pros:
• Has a great LCD panel with very good colors and no problems with the tactile function.
• The fingerprint scanner is very quick when you unlock the phone and also works to use Samsung Internet App with passwords websites like Facebook or Twitter.
• Great battery life. 3300 mAh really lasts all the day for the hard use I do with it.
• Back camera is excellent and the 8 mpxl front camera with LED Flash also works very well and has very good definition.
• The speaker is placed on the right side of the phone, just above the On/Off/Lock/Unlock button, and sounds pretty good, loud and crisp.
• TouchWiz running on Android 6.0.1 is perfect. I have no problems with lag, errors or stops.
• Charges at 1550 mAh, so, you can get it charged in less 2,5 houres (very quick thinking that it has a 3300mAh battery.
• The metal unibody looks beautiful.
• 3GB of RAM really let you have various apps openned at the time.
• Supports until 256 GB of micro-SD memory.
• Dual SIM.
• Very powerful GPU (Mali-T820 MP2) for the type of phone. Make hard graphics games work very well.

? Cons: *for the price of the phone, I really can't request more to Samsung, but there are things I would love to change or add*
• I miss the SuperAMOLED screens. This phone use a very good TFT PLS screen, but there's nothing like the AMOLED screens.
• Underpowered CPU: 1,6 GHz are not the best, but I don't have problems.
• I miss Samsung functions like AirView or the function of take screenshots with the palm of the hand.
• For the unibody of this phone, I would like to have wireless charging function.",Positif

"Worst Samsung phone I've ever owned - and I've happily owned many. Great battery life ... but that's it! Connectivity is terrible. Won't stay connected to ANY Wi-Fi for long. Have to manually turn Wi-Fi off and back on on the phone to reestablish connectivity 1000 times a day. Uses up ALL my data in short order ... something that NEVER happened with ANY other phone. It may start out on Wi-Fi but will (very consistently) drop it and switch to the network. You never know until it's too late. Blue Tooth is as bad if not worse. Will recognize a BT device one time but not again. Will not connect to BT in my vehicle (JVC system) nor my Plantronics headset. Speaker volumne is just okay, but dismal compared to most any other phone. Trying to connect to my array of home devices is a joke ... all of which work perfectly and sync problem-free to ANY other phone. Sonos - disaster. Pool (Hayward AquaConnect) - disaster. Irrigation System (Hydrawise) - forget it. HVAC system (Bryant Housewise) - good luck. Nest Cameras - yeah, right. SimpliSafe - don't bother. It might connect, it might not, it might cause the app to do squirrely things you've never seen before ... and on and on. DONE WITH THIS EXCUSE FOR A PHONE!!!",Negatif
"ATT, TMobile needs LTE Bands 2,4,5,12,17 for 4G LTE. This phone only has Band 5. This Samsung J7 Prime G610F/... may indeed be a good phone. BUT!

"Update: The firm selling this phone claims the label was applied by Samsung at an overseas distribution point, after they removed the phone to activate it on the local national network. I gave the phone a shot despite my concerns and it does not work on AT&T 4g in the USA. It'll get a lower speed network, but not full 4G or LTE. AT&T worked a while trying to make it happen, but said that internally they found notes saying it is not compatible. Too bad. The seller processed a return and I bumped the review up two stars.

I wish Samsung would sell these in the USA. The reason they do not is pretty obvious: nobody would pay for the Samsung S8 if they could have a phone with these specs. There are several features on this phone not even offered on flagship phones in the USA (FM radio, sual-sim, etc.). The S* is more flashy, but it's not worth the money for what I (and most people) do.

Original Review:

Bought this ""factory new"" Samsung phone and it arrives with a fake tamper-evident label over the original factory tamper-evident label, which was previously cut open. The label they put on top is a smudged printed copy of the original Samsung tamper-proof label, only made larger so that it can cover the original. So this is not a one-off mistake. That label was crafted by someone specifically to cover over the factory Samsung label in order to hide tamper seals being disturbed, and I guarantee Samsung did not do it (the printing is bad, and Samsung would not cover a tamper seal with a second one after having opened the original). Again, this is not a one-off. That kind of industry - making fake tamper-proof labels - suggests to me that Mobiles International does this as routine.

Either the phone was used or the seller opened the phone to load apps or malicious code on it. Or both. Either way these guys are not legit. I processed a return, but Amazon really needs to police these sellers better an make guys like this go away.

I got this phone as a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy j7. It's an excellent full of loving the largest screen and the increased storage. It is also very user-friendly and syncs easily with all of my devices. I love it! The phone also shipped quickly arrived properly packaged. I would also recommend purchasing from this seller.,Positif
"My device was built for the United Arab Emirate. It works with my GSM At&T account once I obtained a nano sim chip. It cannot be registered on Samsung USA website. You cannot download an English User manual....know that all up front. The various promotional literature for J7 can be misleading. You cannot open this phone to replace a battery. It does not have an LED light on the front to brighten your face while Skyping. Apparently there have been a number of iterations of J7 model for foreign customers around the world even Prime 2017 models. Mine is plastic...not metal case. That is why I indicated as the phone software clearly indicated it was manufactured for The UAE. There are two quick small ""get started"" instruction sheets; one in arabic and one in english..

I am satisfied with the purchase within its first 24hrs of use. It was intended to replace a Galaxy S5. There is no way this 80 yr old retiree could afford a new S8. Having 32g of ram and a faster processor is a good improvement. The usual hassle of changing all apps and data over to a new cellphone is always present...Twenty-four hours after receipt of the phone, I am still in the midst of getting passwords installed and making certain need apps are working correctly. The frustration of dealing with AT&T support in the Philippines meant going through four different support individuals until finding one that's English was understandable and had the personality to really want to help. My thanks to ""Michael"" for his working with this old man needing the patience that his father would need.",Positif
"No warranty, after a week it broke, would not recognize a simm card, useless except for internet in a wifi spot

Lots of bells and whistles but it just won't work as a phone.",Negatif
"From the face of it I just loved this phone. I bought one for Daughter ... one for me and one for my wife. The 2 phones for me and my wife I could return it immediately as within the month I realized the issue that the phone drops phone calls - other party don't hear your voice at all. Etc.It was too late for me to return daughter's phone as she didnt realize the problem and didnt say to me in time.

This phone is really good for its money but I hate to even give 1 star now. I really loved this phone for its memory / cameras / size / appearance / dual CIM slots etc.

My daughter tells me her friends experience the same issue too.
I am stuck with one piece that my daughter has,",Negatif
I really love this phone. Great product and excellent customer service. Thanks a million!,Positif
The phone did NOT work with T-Mobile in the US. It was not able to connect to 4G or LTE. It would only operate on 2G and E. We took it into 2 T-mobile stores and called their tech support and they confirmed that this model is not set up to receive their signals in the US.,Negatif
Good price for a good android. Everything works well except my keyboard. I've had this phone for 3 months and this has been going on for a month. It won't press the keys my finger touches and vibrates uncotrollably. Sometimes freezing up completely. Only way to stop it is to restart my phone. Very frustrating. But the camera is great.,Positif
Ordered this phone and received a phone case and SD card instead. Had to return it and pay $51 to do so out of my own pocket. Very disappointed will not order from Technomaster again.,Negatif
"I am using this phone on a 4g LTE network, it does not have 4g LTE so it struggles when I'm not on wifi. I knew this when I purchased the phone. It had so many features that the LTE model didn't, that made it an easy trade off. I'm on wifi most of the time anyway. I love this phone, however not everything is intuitive like it is on an iPhone. It's been worth taking the time to read the manual and understand this phones many cool functions! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it lacks the 4g LTE capability, otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars.",Positif
"No problem from the seller, only with the product itself.

I bought this just to use dual SIM.
I placed T-Mobile and AT&T in both the slots. (for freedompop it shows status as roaming but other phones wont show)
I wanted mobile data from AT&T. After I set that SIM within some time the data changes to Tmobile.
And When I connect to wifi and again disconnect the mobile data will be disconnected.
Many times I don't get the mobile data ON even after couple of reboots.

UI is fine though screen resolution is not great.
Only one SIM is 4G, other should be 2G only.
Sound is low.
Battery lasts for long time.
Phone speed/response is good.

The android version I got is 6.0",Negatif
"Data and messaging do not work. Stuck on 3G which is not fast enough to handle anything. The phone itself is fine and fast as long as you don't want to use what makes it a phone, such as calling texting and data. These do not work.",Negatif
"Fast, pretty, excellent for the price.

SIM CARDs are NANO, I had to cut my SIM card.

Camera is Amazing!!",Positif
"This is an awesome phone. If you use CC as your carrier , go to their website and download guide to set up your phone that's some other carrier has or is unlocked. Takes about 3 minutes to set up. Would highly recommend phone.",Positif
"Just received my new phone. I have at&t go phone. So far, everything is working nicely. I am happy.

Update.
I've had the phone since June. I only ran into a problem the first week I had it where it didn't acknowledge my sim card. I just went into settings and mobile networks and re-added at&t. Since then, i have not had any other issues. I really like this phone. It was worth the money.",Positif
"The camera on this phone is phenomenal... not as great as I had hoped but so much better than I anticipated for a $200 phone. So far I really like everything about the phone... wasn't too sure I would like the size, it's the biggest phone I've had so far but I actually am very happy with it. would recommend this to anyone.",Positif
"Working just fine with AT&T. Replaced my Galaxy S3.

MOST CASES AND SCREEN PROTECTORS ADVERTISED FOR GALAXY J7 WILL NOT FIT THIS PHONE. You have to search for the ones to fit the Galaxy ON7.",Positif
After 2 attempts with a sim card my phone is absolutely the best. Other customers at the phone store inquired about my phone and commenting about the quality compared to that being sold in the phone store.,Positif
Does not work with t-moble as advertised,Negatif
"I purchased this phone as a replacement. My current Cell Provider ( Cricket) sells this phone as well, i figured i should have a single issue. I even contacted my provider to make sure this phone will work, they explained that I wont have any issues connecting to their networks. I received the phone in perfect condition, even came with a screen protector already on it. The phone is quick and easy to setup. I enjoyed the feel of it and how fast i received it.

HOWEVER, I AM UNABLE TO GET ANYTHING OVER H+ ( 3G). My original phone was a Asus Zenphone 2 lazer. I had it for nearly three years never once did i have an issue where i wasn't able to utilize the 4g network. All wireless settings have been verified to be correct. The phone actually picked up on the settings within minutes of having the Sim inserted.

BUYER BEWARE - Seller neglected to explicitly state that this phone will not work on LTE networks within the USA. Something with the phone not being able to connect to certain bands.",Negatif
"I have been using this phone for three weeks now and it is great. The camera is awesome and the pictures are crisp and clear. The dual sim feature is very useful as one number is for personal calls and the other for business, so I do not have to travel with two phones. I have not tried the fingerprint feature as i am still familiarizing myself with the phone. Easy to carry in my purse and pocket too. All in all a good phone for the price.",Positif
"Really disappointed my 4G lite T-Mobile did not work. I went over my data mysteriously as well as I've never done that. The finger sensor is a plus and good feature. Not a bad phone but missing a few features my Galaxy 5 had. Does stick sometimes. Wish the interface for the time and weather was better (like my Galaxy 5). For the price, ok. Shipping was fast as I was in a fix and needed a phone asap. The verdict is still out on this phone.",Positif
Solid Samsung.,Positif
Easy to set up and would recommend. The only issue it takes a Mini SIM card and I had to purchase another one for $55.00. It is compatible with Walmart Family Mobile (T-Mobile). One of the reason to purchased the phone was the 32GB memory. You may need to purchase a new case. I had a J5 Samsung previously and this phone is longer.,Positif
"i sold my iphone to get the money to purchase this phone, was very excited for it to get here. then my excitement turned to anger and disappointment. it say this phone is factory unlocked, meaning any sim card and any service should work on it. well i put my straight talk sim card in and it kept saying ""unknown sim card"" my phone bill is paid meaning it should work. well i called straight talk and they informed me that not only is the phone not factory unlocked and will only work on certain phone companies, but also, on this certain phone, 4G LTE will not pick up on it in the USA. very angry about my experience and am sending it back.",Negatif
"This is a deception, I would term with such a strong word. I have a fairly functional T mobile sim. I inserted my sim into this phone, and then 90% time call dropped, voice cut out. Most importantly, the mobile data didn't connect. Neither T mobile or Samsung customer care could solve this problem even after 2-hour of extensive manual setup. Finally, Samsung customer care concluded that this set was made in United Arab Emirates or so and it won't function in the US.

A total waste of my valuable work hour and effort. Even I wrote to Amazon for a compensation, but not satisfied with their apology only.",Negatif
Wanted a new phone I have a pre paid net 10 so new phones are not cheap. I must say I am very pleased with this phone did a lot of review before I ordered and decided not to turn on the fingerprint sensor because of the issues other people have had. For the price this phone is great good display 32gb of storage awesome selfies and because it's unlocked I didn't even need a new sim card. I also love that im in Alaska and she shipping was fast and on time. If your wanting a newer within this year released phone I really recommend this one.,Positif
"Arrived as promised and works great. Only have had for a week and am still learning to use it. Works on Straight Talk here in the States just fine. Be warned that when it comes to buying a case that it is a 2016 release and not 2017. The latter cases won't fit correctly. Took me 2 tries and checking the ""ABOUT"" section of my phone to find this out. D'oh!",Positif
"This review is rather late, a year after buying this phone. This is an excellent phone and I've had no problems for a year, using it in the Cayman Islands, Antigua, India, UK, and the US. However, I visited New York for a short vacation this August, and was disappointed to note that I was having problems. I checked with my service provider T-Mobile in New York. They tell me that it is the U1900 issue, they do not suport that band any more. I checked with AT&T too, same story. So this phone will not work well in New York. I am getting and occasional E for internet or nothing. Calls drop. At tge time of writing this review, it works fine in Miami. While this is a carrier issue, I hope that this review will help others make an informed choice.",Positif
Love the quality of the build nice storage space and sufficient ram and the cpu keeps it from lagging. I had an S5 decided to give this a shot and loved the build. Though no 4g so I deducted a star for that and the battery life. The is alright but could be better. But the battery isn't good. Mine runs dead not as quick as the J3 but it goes pretty quick I usually get 9 hours of use be cause I won't allow my phone drop below 25% before putting it on charge.,Positif
"My husband was still using a flip phone with terrible sound, so this was a very good upgrade to a smart phone without the outrageous prices for the other models. It does everything my S6 does and it is easy to use. Great option for a person that is not tech savvy as well. The only negative is that is difficult to find accessories for it like a case and extra charger, but we found them.",Positif
Excellent cellphone!,Positif
"I am using this phone with AT&T in the US. The only problem I have is with using google maps. The GPS signal is bad. Also when I text a specific person, they only receive some of my texts but that could be their fault. I've had this phone for a year now. Usually I break my phone screens within 6 months but I haven't broken this one yet! I keep a glass screen protecter and a case on at all times. The camera isn't as good as an iPhone x but it has pretty good quality! It is a good phone for the price.",Positif
"This phone was bought based on good product customer reviews and its tagged as an ""Amazon Choice."" However the device was defective - continuous onscreen flickering. Troubleshooting results showed this is a known issue with this model.
Steps taken:
Step 1: Restart your Galaxy J7 in Safe Mode and observe if the screen still flickers
Step 2: Try deleting the system caches through the Recovery Mode
Step 3: Perform the master reset procedure on your Galaxy J7

This did not resolve the issue at all.",Negatif
"Love this phone!! I have MetroPcs and had ZERO problems activating it. I put the SIM card in, called Metro and in literally 5 minutes l was good to go!! I bought this phone during Prime Day so l also got a good deal!!! Awesome seller!! Thank you very much!!!",Positif
Did not work with 3 different carriers. Returned the phone and tried to get the carriers to refund the money and they would not so this ended up being a very costly phone in the end.,Negatif
"T Mobile Disaster...Had ATnT and switched over to Tmobile and only receive 2G data plan. So don't buy if you have Tmobile this phone does not work in USA. Did all the tech support, went to tmobile store and nothing. I also have the same problem with my J5 Prime phone...only 2G data plan. Thanks Samsung for screwing me along with lousy comments on Amazon the phone worked on T-mobile.",Negatif
Completely satisfied once I got past the Arabic defaults. Plenty of memory and dual sim is great for international travel. Screen is large enough. Little bloatware from pre-installed apps. Highly recommended. No Regrets.,Positif
"It's a great phone for this price. I'm not giving 5 stars because the fingerprint sensor doesn't work as well as I expected, but it still works ok",Positif
"This phone not only does it continually say it's not registered and won't let me use it, but the ear buds that came with it, kept sending electrical shocks to my ears, and I can't use them!",Negatif
Received item in original untouched package. Item exactly as described. Easily transferred my old Samsung S5 total contents to this model. Took phone to Asia to make use of dual sim function....performed with excellence. Would highly recommend this phone to anyone who plans to travel or have need for a second sim. Allows you to switch off one sim....so you don't run the risk or expense of roaming charges. Battery is decent strength.,Positif
Love this phone. I've had it for about a year now. Takes nice pictures and is totally usable.,Positif
"The only con is that it's a lot bigger than I expected and I have small hands. The plus to that is the screen is amazing, I don't have to squint to see. It's fast with lists of storage space plus room for a memory card which is great. I am in love with this phone so far and loved the price I got it for.",Positif
"Moved up from a smart trac phone, no comparrison, easy to use, and I love it.",Positif
"*Have used for 1-month prior to writing this review*
I wish I had known about this phone sooner. It's basically the Galaxy S7, but without all the crazy features that you probably don't need. It has the same processor and gobs of RAM (very very fast!) and lots of advanced features for A LOT LESS. It's the S7 minus things like eye-tracking, waterproofing, and wireless charging. If you don't really need those things, you could save $500 by getting this. It has the same metal body, great cameras, the finger scanner, wide selfie camera lens, expandable storage, and a full 1080p HD screen, among other things. If you want a premium phone without the premium price, then this is it. NOTE: I currently use this on AT&T prepay in the United States.",Positif
"Good purchase. Love it OVER the Motorola. Simply HATE the Motorola phone, but would not have gotten this one, which I like had the Motorola not been a bust. Nice feel and design. Great price over the IPhones and they do the SAME THINGS.",Positif

I love this phone. It has functions that I've never had in a smartphone. The dual-sim outlets are cool but I don't have a second SIM card working yet.,Positif
"The back button doesn't work most of the time. Phone seems like it's refurbished rather than new. It's slow. I actually prefer my original J7 but it stopped charging which is why I bought this. I like the extra memory. I didn't like that I had to download the Google home page.

Update - doesn't work well with Cricket. Google Maps AND Waze won't load half the time and claim they can't connect to the net because there is no service even though I full bars & connection. (Yes, I pay my bill on time). Back button has gotten worse at not working. Freezes all the time. Have to restart it frequently to get to connect to so I can even make a phone call or send a text. Apps don't work half the time.",Negatif

"This Phone lasted less than 4 months, it worked "" okay at best. HAS NO LTE OR 4G. Service was slow, but I tried to be considerate since i am an optimistic person, this phone was so bad it broke me. I wouldn't give this phone as a present even my worst enemy.",Negatif

"I don't get 5GHz only logs on in at 2.4GHz
It does not come with a SIM card; you need to get one from your carrier service.

Much better phone than J7 Prime. Still not an S model though. The wifi signal can not be held as well as my old S4,Positif
It was a European database and dint work with us tmobile. Locked immediately.,Negatif
"It started out promising enough. The phone was working as intended. All of a sudden, not even a few weeks after acquiring it, I started noticing 'missed call' and voicemail notifications. WTH? How could I have missed any of these calls; even at home the phone doesn't stray more than a few feet from me--and the ringtone gets loud enough. It's a dual-SIM design, so maybe one SIM slot went bad? It's possible, right, so I switched the card to the other slot. The problem not only continued but got worse. I was playing phone tag with a contractor and was waiting for him to call and No Joy. None of his calls were coming in, even with me staring at the phone, waiting for the call.

Every other feature and function of the phone is useless when the primary reason for this device is Just. Not. Working. Can I give zero stars?",Negatif
Working fine with AT&T.,Positif

"In the phones description it says it can connect to 4G networks, but it doesn't. I used the same SIM card from T-mobile that I've used for years and have always had great service. But when I put SIM in this phone Icould only get 2 bars max,
usually didn't have service at all. No service makes the phone useless so returning. I've never had this issue before. I'm not sure if it has something to do with it being an international use phone.",Negatif

"This phone will NOT work in US with T-Mobile. Not sure about other carriers. You will need the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime G610M. This is G610F. Just a heads up so you don't have to go through the hastle of getting it and returning it and all that. The phone itself is lovely and works well. It is very slippery, though.

"I have this phone for over a month now it was working ok and in my previous review I gave it 4 stars and I only had two small issues with it that I did not like one it does not support the high speed of 4G lite with T mobile it only supports 3G and the H+ speed, the second thing is the wire for the charger is too short it does not reach the top of my desk and I have to place it on the ground. Another issue that happened three times already is the phone froze and there was a dark screen. I hope it does not freeze again. I will update my review if it keeps freezing. I can still watch videos while in the train with the 3G and H+ speeds.",Positif
"This is a good phone but please note that it only works with a nano SIM card. Switching out the phone with one that uses a bigger SIM card will not work especially if the card was previously cut. It's not going to work with those SIM cards that you just slip into the back of the phone in that slot made for the SIM card. With this phone, it goes into the side and the space will only take the small nano card. I tried to get my SIM card cut to fit the space but it didn't work. So the phone is pretty useless until I can see if the provider will replace the cars with a nano card of their own making and backing up my info into that new card. Sigh!",Negatif
"Great phone, works good with the 2 sim cards, the only problem I have is that when I charge my phone and its a 100% battery as soon as I disconnected it takes like 10 seconds to be at 99% and goes down very fast compare with the J7 2016",Positif
"No indication that this phone will not work on T-Mobile 4G LTE. I purchased this for members of my family that are new to smart phones and this caused them so much grief to get working that they dont even want to return it anymore.

After more research it turns out that it is a LTE band that is not supported in the USA.
The price is the same at T-MOBILE store, $225 and I purchased it for $220 from this supplier.",Negatif
"I'm enjoying my J7 phone. It's a reasonable cost, it has a higher memory than my old phone S4, and the camera takes pretty good photos. I'm not paying a whole paycheck for a phone, and I'm happy with that.

Lo0ss of a star for this point: I have photos I never took (they're grainy icon-sized) that I suspect came from the infernal advertisements that came pre-loaded with the phone. Some are of illustrations or cars or grainy photographs of stock models.",Positif
I love these Samsung phones. I did not want to spend over 500.00 for a new cell phone! I needed a smart phone for a reasonable cost. This phone has all of the functions my last Samsung (S5) had and I didn't have to spend 800.00 for a Samsung 8. Worth the cost if you do not care about having the latest and greatest technology.,Positif
I ordered a 32 GB phone. The box says 32GB but the phone says and is 16GB. I need this to be fixed,Negatif
"Faster then my S8, bought it for my Dad and now I feel I wasted money on the newer phone. Definitely a great phone. MUST BUY!",Positif
"I'd advise if you want a good phone to spend a little more, do some research and get a different phone. This one does the standard stuff ok, however is really glitchy on vital apps such as Google Maps. Google Maps does not work half the time and that is an essential use for my cell. Also, sound ""drops into a hole' and sounds like it's coming from a reverb chamber in many apps. Keyboard is spotty and glitches intermittently. Why 2 stars? Well the majority of the features work, &some decent features. If you're not a power phone user, it won't make that much difference and may be a good phone for those who use a cell but don't rely on it to carry on their daily tasks and functions.

I am amending this review to advise against buying unless you want a 'brand name phone' for not a lot of money. This phone has been bad enough to turn me away from Samsung. If they are willing to put their name on this kind of junk, I'm not trusting of their other branding anymore. Sad thing about the phone is it LOOKS great, but I need one that performs, not glitches out on me when I need it... Like on the way to the airport!",Negatif
"GPS, Whatsapp, viber, and more - none of the apps works on network, they only work when connected to WIFI. 4G doesn't catch either.
call quality is very bad, overall very bad phone.",Negatif
"I purchased this phone for my mother as a gift. She desperately needed an upgrade. Hella bang for the buck! She loves it! It came brand new in box with all accessories.. She's only had it a few days. I'll update in a few months...

**Update
The phone came with j2 hardware and started acting all crazy after one month.. it still works better than her old phone but it restarts and erases all the storage. This phone isn't worth the money.",Negatif
DO NOT BUY! This phone is GARBAGE and does not work on the T-Mobile network in the US!! Get your phone from your carrier because you know it will work!! or if not you will have some kind of recourse! This phone does not register on the T-Mobile network like the description says! It is very sad because I am out hundreds of dollars as it is too late to return the phone!! Save yourself the headache and buy your phone from your carrier or a local seller like Best Buy where you can walk into the store!! THIS SUCKS because you trust the online seller who takes your money to send you a product that works!,Negatif
"I went from a galaxy grand prime, to this, as I assume a lot people will. If you like the grand prime, but realize it's becoming outdated, this is a great phone. I was a bit sceptical about the speaker being on the right side instead of on the back, but it's much better on the side. Cameras are great, screen quality is great, buttons are way better than the grand prime, all for a price that won't make you want to sell your car.",Positif
This phone is so nice .i love it.i would recommend this phone,Positif
"If I could no stars. I was disappointed. It said unload phone. Well if you lived overseas. Sad thing you have to put your stuff on the phone to find out. Not a happy camper. If I could I would give it no stars. Well, I guess it shipped on time.",Negatif

I love everything about this phone.... compliments my style....",Positif
"So far I'm not impressed with this phone. The ""fingerprint recognition"" software does not work--in fact it punishes the owner of the phone because of its own inadequacy. It does not recognize my fingerprint, even though it was programmed to recognize my print. It shuts me out of the phone. Can't get in.",Negatif
"The Phone, does not bring light in the front camera, very careful. Mucho cuidado por que el teléfono NO trae flash en la cámara frontal.",Positif
Very bad not good stuff wen I received it's already damaged after I returned stuff I did not get my refund almost 1 month. Like cheating with customers,Negatif
"I think most of the negative feedbacks are due to the fact that people did not do their research. This is a GSM compatible phone. Do not buy it if you run off of the CDMA towers. AT&T subsribers will be happy. Verizon, not so much. Anyway, the phone is awesome. Take note though... The multiple slots are: 2 x nano SD slots and 1 x mini SD. Most people do not know what nano SD is (I didn't so look up nano SD before you buy). Anywho, one mini SD will work like a champ for me. As long as you are aware of the above, no problems. The phone is fantastic. If you have questions, feel free to ask.",Positif

"After several months of looking for Galaxy Smart Phones, I am glad it end up with this one. It works perfectly as expected and paid about half the price of Galaxy S7..I dont use it as a phone that much but use for playing Crash of Clan all the time. Other functions that I like most is to do banking online by deposit checks without making a trip to the bank ( PNC Bank). It works like a tablet, with 5.5"" screen, so we can check the weather report, read the news, listens to music, vidio from utube, etc. Highly recommended.",Positif

"I had several problems with this phone and now have started using it as my number 2. I went back to using my Note 1 as my primary. I don't know if it is because of my technical inabilities due to being geriatric, or too much going on in the phone. For the most part, the phone has it all, but I'm going to have to figure out why I got lots of calls and messages that were either delayed or never received. My Note 1 never lets me down. I am now looking to check out the new LG G6.",Positif
Don't buy this phone !! If you already have a j7 it's nothing better the screen sucks gps sucks the signal is h+ like a higher form of 3g and? would drop to e which nothing like 1g or 2g nice looking phone the fingerprint? scanner is useless,Negatif

"I have no real issues with this phone. I bought mine in the PI while on vacation. My primary cell got submerged in 3"" of sea water in a boat. Anyway, it accepted my T-mobile sim card with no issue while overseas and when returning to the US. While overseas I was receiving 2g data and it would pick up 3g networks when available. Now stateside, I adjusted the setting to receive LTE. Reception is prob 8/10, screen is great, 9/10, battery life is 8/10, and ease of use 8/10. Having dual sim slots is great and tons of expandable memory up to 256GB! Rear Camera does take nice pics. I get complements on pics I take with it. It's not the perfect phone nor near the bottom, it's a great above avg phone with decent hardware and specs. I like it, but I will move to a ruggedized phone with IP68 ratings due to my lifestyle. Buy it if you are on a budget for a $200+ phone. It's a capable phone.",Positif
"Got the J7prime as gift since my Asus screen started going crazy. Anyway, I was style of phone, features etc., until I couldn't receive mms pictures. This was a problem since day one. I called tmobile and Samsung twice and even went to tmobile. All were in competent. I even went on utube and did as instruction. Now I'm ready to return phone. Just so happen, great niece heard me complaining and decided to troubleshoot. She appeared to have resolved issue. I was glad to have not to have to return.(happy,happy happy). Hold up, what a minute, premature glee. Next morning no mms picture was able to be view. You guessed it, the phone and accessories will be returned today. Live and learn, the next will be researched throughly, reviews and all. I have tmobile SIM cards. They worked perfectly with the Asus Zenfone. Would now have this Samsung issue if Asus screen had not gone haywire.",Negatif
Excelent,Negatif
"Price vs. Value. We all like the scale to be balanced. In this case, the scale is not balanced! It bottoms out on the right (the Value) side! This phone is worth far more than the $120 I paid for it (at Net10.com, not Amazon, then $35 per month plan)! I am so glad I did not spend hundreds of dollars on another phone. Remember, this is a Samsung and the phone absolutely represents a quality name. The last phone I owned was for four years. You heard me, 4 years. I expect the same life out of this one and it does everything a more expensive phone does. So, don't be a sucker. I hear one is born every minute. That's not you, is it?",Positif
"I find this phone extremely annoying-- It has dual sim cards, which I needed for international travel, but it DOES NOT SUPPORT WI-FI CALLING! When I came back to the USA I found that the phone was not fully compatible with T-mobile's frequencies. It had reception in some US places, but clearly lacked widespread coverage.",Negatif
"You'll love this phone if you like to listen to 13 rings before the ringing goes to voicemail, it drives me crazy. I end up leaving my phone turned off, and then miss important calls. And the reason I purchased this phone was to cancel out my land line, but I can't do that now, since this Samsung is not user friendly. I will never purchase another Samsung product. Metro PCS says the way Samsung made the phone, the number of rings can't be changed. Don't think I'll have this phone for very long, I should have purchased an iPhone 6 Plus, or LG would be less expensive.",Negatif
Not bad but full of Bloatware that cant be removed. Large number of Samsung Apps you cant disable and background services that nag you if they are used and nag you constantly to use them if you don't.,Negatif

The S7 I have now , the micro USB port has gone through rough times and only charges rapidly via wirelessly . Also not sure if this is ip68?",Positif
received phone had to wait a day for AT&T to send me a nano sim card. Once up and running the screen will not react to touch and when it does is very slow. Home screen will show date and time; once swiped this will disappear and the screen will turn gray then black and goes back to home screen. Very upsetting since this is the first day of use.,Negatif
Great upgrade! My last phone was an S3 and I loved it. But it was time to upgrade. It has ALL the features that I have come to enjoy with Samsung and Android. My only complaint is that I can't figure out how to move storage of an app from internal to my SD card.,Positif

I've had this phone for a little over a month and already it's ghost touching. The camera is pretty decent. It comes with a flashlight and some decent apps.

In addition, it uses micro sd cards and Two nano sim card slots.",Negatif
"1 month: Works well, nothing much to say. The edges are half-flimsy and half-hard so you can wrap it around your phone. It has not slipped off or fallen off once. Very tight on there.

1 year 7 months: back button no longer working (on the bottom right) when i tap the base of where the headphones plug into.....it acts as if i pressed the back button and makes no sense......so if its in your pocket and you tog on the cord on accident even a tiny it...it goes back.
