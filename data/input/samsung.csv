"Phone frequently starts talking out loud (even if in your pocket or bag) because the dedicated had button pushes up against something. You can follow on-line instructions to disable the voice talking, but every time the phone auto-updates the operating system (which is forced upon you), the ""Bixby voice assistant"" is reverted to default mode. So, phone starts talking out loud at random times again.

Do EVERYTHING you can do to avoid this phone. Do NOT buy any phone with ""Bixby"" associated with it. Samsung thinks it's smarter than you, so they took away your ability to disable the voice thing permanently, and they made it impossible to re-purpose the additional button for anything. Total garbage.",Negatif
"Very disappointed. Purchased from Amazon Warehouse and apparently the phone was not inspected as the device was locked for use. Also, I noticed an abnormal battery drain and that's only on wifi; imagine how much worse the battery would be with a sim card and data signal. I'm giving another 3rd party a chance,
and honestly I'm not really optimistic . Amazon provided me a courtesy credit which was nice; however, there's no real way of knowing if the seller is blacklisted.",Negatif

"I bought this phone thinking that it would be better than my current S6 Edge - and just about in every way it is specially low light shots, but disappointed with the picture AI results in general. I normally use my phone as a camera, less so as a computer or streaming device.

Sure wide shots look indiscernible, but once you want to see some details the S9+ images become murky at 100% zoom as the Auto settings normally changes to F1.5 (no you cannot force it to use F2.4 in auto mode - which most users use) Fonts looks blotchy upon closer inspection. Yes I understand you can set it to Pro mode so you can do this, but most times I use my phone to take pictures within 3 secs, no time for fiddling with settings.

The S6 has a 16M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 12M.
The 9+ has a 12M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 9M.
Quite possible this may be causing it, but I read the Pixel has the same resolution but takes better photos because of the AI implementation.
I normally shoot at 16x9 size settings so it fills my monitor screen and FB uploads, and this is how I compared the shots.
Aside from the uploaded picture, I have also compared outside scenes on both phones - and I do notice slightly murkier pictures with the S9+.

In the DLSR world, sometimes you get bad lens so the logical thing is to replace the lens for a sharper one, but not everyone has this luxury with a phone specially if you are at a mobile carrier store with strict use limits. I did a little research and found forums where people complain of the image quality as well, so I don't think I'm in the minority.",Negatif
"My three stars has more to do with Amazon's screw up than the phone itself.

WHEN YOU GET YOUR PHONE, CHECK THE MODEL NUMBER !!!
SHOULD BE SM-G960U1.

I ordered the US unlocked Galaxy S9 (model number SM-G960U1), BUT Amazon sent me a Chinese unlocked phone (model number SM-G9600). Although they look the same, the Chinese phone only sort of works (dropped calls, poor sound quality, incoming calls go straight to voice mail), does NOT have a US warranty (all support comes out of China), and critical features your carrier offers will be disabled (such as T-Mobile's Wifi Calling).

It took me over a month to figure out why my wonderful Galaxy S9 was a piece of crap. And neither Amazon nor Samsung were of much help in discovering the source of my problem. It wasn't until I tried to register my phone with Samsung's U.S. website and failed that I got a clue.

After much to do, Amazon replaced my Chinese phone with the correct one. Like magic everything appears to be working fine including Wifi Calling.",Positif

"Had to get a new phone, and really dislike the other options. The major drawbacks for this phone are the edge display, which is impossible to find a good screen protector for, and the fact that after recently cracking the display, I realized it costs roughly half the price of the phone to replace. Other than the price of the display and the obnoxious, and seemingly pointless beveled ""edge"", I absolutely love the camera, and the phone is very fast. The Sprint network obviously does the phone zero justice, so you may want to change service providers to benefit the the performance that this phone has to offer.",Negatif

"It's clear now that mine arrived defective. A problem started as intermittent and got worse: people couldn't hear me on speakerphone, and sometimes in handset mode too. I had a long call with tech support 3 months in, which ended in my hard-resetting the phone. The problem seemed to go away but didn't really. Then I dropped the phone getting a functional, and barely visible crack. I eventually confronted the problem again, calling tech support. I mentioned the crack and they said this would not impede repair under warranty. As instructed, I brought it to UfixIbreak, where I was told that a) the drop voided the warranty for all parts b) they would replace the broken part without also doing the screen even though I didn't need it done. So the cost for me was not zero but $340.

When my Korean car gets rear-ended, does that automatically void all the warranty on all the engine parts?

I am livid and definitely won't buy a Samsung again.",Negatif

"I purchased a s9+ about a month ago from Samsung , this phone and all the phones that have Bixby have a system Virus that Samsung tells me you can not remove. This is why it is a virus, it installs itself you can turn it off but it will reinstall itself and turn itself back on. When it does that it gives complete access to everything on your phone if you accidently hit the button on the side or swipe left. and it can't be stopped according to Samsung customer service.
This virus is bad, ""REAL BAD"" unless of course you do not mind sharing all you phone numbers , emails , texts call history email addresses, photos , videos , etc.
I love the phone it is the best camera I have seen, but the phone itself stinks, because of this virus.
if you accidentally pick up the phone and press the button or swipe too far left Bang! the virus is back in 6 different places and all your personal data is accessible to the virus even though you spent the time to turn the VIRUS off in the 6 places and remove permissions , one little slip of the finger and the virus is back in full force.

I have no Idea why Samsung would insist on accessing my personal information when I have tried to disable their virus software BIXBY , and it still propagates back on the phone.

Samsung told me it is not a virus, what is the definition of a virus, my thoughts are , if it is something you can not stop from propagating in the OS , and It has full access to everything on your phone , and once deleted or deactivated propagates itself back on the phone, and again gives full access to you personal files and information to the Virus called ""BIXBY""",Negatif

"So different from previous models. Removed many of the options i need and loved. Sad.

I needed lots more internal memory. Almost left galaxy after many years due to curved screen and sillyvedge...and bixby.

I was advised by many techs not to purchase this model. I finally decided based on slo mo and avitar added to more memory.

Still don't like iPhones but feel they are much more sturdy and have better batteries. But they have no micro sd card! What the heck???

When galaxy removes sd card i'll have to switch to iPhone as I can no longer replace batteries in galaxy now. Dumb!

Very complex phone with Long learning curve. Too many options! Hate curved infinity screen, bixby & edge. Useless waste!

64 gb memory is great so far. Once you buy alexa you need so much more internal memory.

Not sure how long battery will last. Crossing my fingers since it can't be replaced. Oh crap!

Why on earth did they use curved infinity screen? Very hard to find case and screen protectors that work. Makes it so fragile.

What is value and purpose of ""bixby""? Also find ""edge""useless and unnecessary.

Great stereo sound on movies.

Only downside was the cheap glass screen which cracked not even a month after I had it, and the mediocre pic quality. This time around, Amazon had a deal with the S9 and a free Echo Show (which I was able to hock on ebay). I was expecting leaps and bounds vs my old Moto. However I've been somewhat disappointed. 1. The battery life sucks on this phone! I find myself having to throw it on a charger otherwise it will barely make it through a full day. 2. The fingerprint scanner is garbage compared to the Moto. I personally prefer the scanner on the front, but the S9 seems to have a delay that can be frustratingly annoying after a while. And yes I've taken multiple scans and re-scans of my prints.

What's with those curved edges! My screen already has a couple of scratches and I still can't find a screen protector that doesn't piss me off. At this rate, I'm going to need another phone in 6 months... but perhaps that's what Samsung is hoping.

It's not all about length; it's how you use it! When holding the S5 in one hand, my thumb doesn't reach to the top of the screen; it's now a two-handed device. Plus (pun intended), it's too long for my jeans pocket and it jabs into me when I bend at the waist.

In addition, it does not hold its value. It�s unbelievable to me that a OnePlus will sell on EBay for 95% of its purchase price every 6 months when the new version arrives. But I bought this on Cyber Monday for $547 plus tax with a normal price of $899 and it�s selling on EBay in the 400s! that�s ridiculous drop in value compared to OnePlus.

"Samsung does not care about customer satisfaction. For them customer-centric culture is a very foreign idea. This is my experience. I will never buy Samsung electronic device again and will convince all my friends and family to avoid that trainwreck also.

Bought this phone new in July 2018, at Best Buy. Phone started to act up couple months later, not taking up the charge, finally turning into a brick. And since then it was a road through hell of Samsung (questionable) quality and dealing with the worst customer service I have ever encountered... It is unbelievable, because I expected Samsung to be on par with Apple, but boy, am I disappointed!

So - it has essentially been the following cycle: would not take charge -- repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - then I finally decided to call customer service again, but demanding refund, being fed up with this whole brand altogether. It's been quite a ride with those guys, too! It took them first a few days to reply, oh sorry, I take it back - to do nothing, then I called last Friday (12/07) demanding refund again. Then I was told 48 hrs for decision. Then nothing, so I called Wednesday, after 72 hours and was escalated to someone else who told me it is up to five days, so I need to wait until Friday 12/14 (today) and they'd call me with the decision. So I waited till Friday's late afternoon because - of course - nobody called, and after being elevated again, spending about 2 hr and demanding information, I was told the phone cannot be refunded, not even exchanged! Only repaired again (because they have policies that say that main board has to be replaced). Next week I was supposed to get this phone on an international trip. Now I am stranded without one, I just haven't got some $700's around to buy new phones anytime I feel for it.

It is unbelievable that they have some unrealistic policies and it does not matter that phone breaks 4 times (the same thing) and they would not replace it, let alone refund it, cause ""it wasn't motherboard"". My communications with even 2nd level manager was just as that - pointless. Banging my head against the wall of some corporate baloney - rather than being cared about as a customer who does genuinely get hit by their product poor quality.

"****UPDATE 1/14/19****
My original review for the phone is below. I have owned this for 1 month and found my phone would not update to the latest firmware, it kept saying it was up to date from July 2018 even though Samsungs website showed monthly updates. I contacted Samsung, provided the IMEI number for the phone and found it was factory locked to a specific carrier (not mine and NOT the one seller said it was unlocked for.) I contacted that carrier and found it was unpaid by the owner and would be locked until that person paid it off, the IMEI was held against the original owners social security number due to the unpaid balance and they told me to return the phone, the seller was committing a form of fraud by selling me that phone. I would ALWAYS suggest contacting Samsung with the IMEI number to verify it IS fully unlocked before putting all of your info into the new phone.

***Original review****
There are only 2-3 downfalls I have found with this phone and one related to the seller, I bought a refurbished phone and it still had the old phone number registered to it which is a fault on the seller, but also a caution to anyone buying refurbished.
The other ""downfalls"" are related to the curved edge screen. It is impossible to find a case that protects the screen on all sides due to this. I have found multiple cases that are raised on the top and bottom keeping the screen off tabletops when face down however the sides are still exposed. The other is I can see a slight flicker on the sides if I turn the phone slightly, this may or may not be with every phone or just mine since it was refurbished.

Now onto the good!
The speaker quality feels like the phone is it's own handheld movie theater. The color is extraordinary. Battery life has been better than my previous s7 but not as good as I was expecting for a model 2 years newer and the plus version. Response time is impeccable. There is bass with the sound. No lagging whatsoever. Highly recommend the phone just note the curved edges are exposed and that part makes me nervous.",Negatif

"I bought this for my dad to activate as a Verizon phone. It is NOT the same phone you'd get at Verizon. He spent so much time calling Samsung and they told him this-
This phone will not have the identical capabilities as what you'd buy at Verizon.

These are TWO big things that doesn't make sense to go without when you pay this much for a phone. SO upset.",Negatif
"Several reviews said this unlocked phone would be fine with Boost Mobile. Took it into a boost store and the lady behind the counter was really nice and she tried and tried and could not get it to work with Boost. Even though Boost sells this exact same phone.... hmm...

"To access the home screen or menu of your favorites, you have to swipe the edge of the screen. Unfortunately, If you already have an app on the screen this swiping will frequently affect the app instead of showing the menu.

"I have a Galaxy S7 that I love. Despite being big, it feels nice in my hand and is easy to use. The S9 with its curved edges was infuriating to use. My palm kept hitting the side of the screen when I reached across the phone.

And I really don't get the point of the curved edge. It doesn't do anything useful I care about, it just makes it hard to use. I think Samsung decided they had to do something interesting and different to give it a ""wow"" factor, despite it being worse than useless.

So my brother says you can get a big case to cover up the edges to solve the problem. Ok, but if the solution is to just cover the edges up, what's the point of having it in the first place???

And it's super tall. Which I also don't understand. It makes it hard for my thumb to reach the top of the phone.

I feel like Samsung has fallen into the trap where their shareholders just want the stock to keep going up, so it's not enough to sell a million phones, they have to sell 2 million next quarter, so instead of making a good useful phone they are going to make a gimmicky phone to try to attract people with new gimmicks even if they're not useful.

I returned the S9 after a day of use and I'm back to my S7. I'll probably get a Pixel 3 instead eventually.",Negatif
"I upgraded from an iPhone 6S when that died. This phone is a big disappointment. The main complaint is the touchscreen. Since it goes all the way to the edge it often adds 0 or p, especially if I use my thumb. The auto tire in to my Ford is also buggy at best. Usually getting a new phone is great but this one has been a big disappointment. I'd avoid it if I were you.",Negatif
"The phone is fast, with a solid build. But the signal reception is horrible. At my home the signal is always weak, but my Motorola G5 Plus had much better reception. The range for cell service is -50 to -120. Closer to -50 is better, but this S9 is -118 in a weak area, but still -113 in a good area! If you don't need a 3.5mm headphone jack, then get the Z3 Play. It's far better as a phone, and motorola really knows what they're doing with convenience. I loved my G5+, but I loved my Samsung S3, S4 and S5 too. But this S9 is pretty poor.",Negatif

"I'm very upset over this item, I've wanted this phone for months and when I finally buy it and take it to my carrier, they can't activate it. When they put the Sim card in it says ""phone not allowed"". I spent over an hour calling different numbers to figure out what was going on and the only nswer I got was that it must not be unlocked like it said it was. I called Amazon support and they researched it and said that it's supposed to work with metroPCS, band they don't under why it isnt. Amazonis refunding my money but it still upsets me because I had my heart set on it.",Negatif
"I have now purchased 2 - one right after the other. Not from here. The litany of problems - and I will have to summarize...1. battery died to 3% first day. No gaming. No nothing, except talking for a couple of hours and taking a few pictures. Truly. 2.) Ringtones would not work for texting, UNLESS I was talking on the phone. This was before the Master REset. Otherwise, I just got the vibration and ""aaagh). Again. It was nothing I had done or not done. Called Carrier - again - Consumer Cellular - and was told to do something you could not do to this phone - hard shock - was told to take it to Target. I did not get it from Target. Got a Supervisor - we did a Master Reset. After that, I could not even use it as a phone. No texting. No phone calls.
#2 phone. Messes with my files. Ringtones won't work with texting - unless I'm talking - the battery bleeds like nobody's business. I don't game. I don't bank. I just got the bloody thing because my J7 went bad... and I wanted a larger screen. This thing tells me that the ""badges"" will show with I receive a message or phone notification. They don't. Again, not my bad. This is BEYOND glitchy.
Don't Do It.",Negatif
Buyer beware. Unlocked phones do not support some carrier features like video calling and wifi calling. I bought this s9 plus to use on Verizon wireless and these features are blocked. The reason they are blocked is because it's an unlocked phone and Verizon wants you to spend the big bucks buying the phone from them to use all the features the phone supports. It BS really but that's just how it is. So if you buy this or any unlocked phone then you can expect some of the features not to work. I warned you.,Negatif
"Big surprise when I received it. The box had US Cellular logo on it and the phone was a Sprint Locked!!!!! . (Found out when I gave the IMEI to samsung customer service).

"Wow. After 3 days of using (without a single drop) I've noticed the camera's glass cover is cracked. Next day I am already having dust particles under it. Quick google and I see I am not the only one (there are many). I've noticed this last night after I left a warm building and on the outside it was pretty cold. The funny thing is that many other users with this problem noticed that the temperature difference might be the problem. And yeah, most of them have owned their samsung phones for only few days/weeks too. So it seems like if it doesn't happen to you in few weeks/months after buying then you are safe.

I am deducting two stars because I tried to register the phone for warranty service to find that it couldn't be registered. So I'm pulling one star for amazon listing it as having a US warranty, and one star from Samsung for not being able to register the product. I will continue to test the functionality of this phone in the coming week. Great value for the money if Samsung supports the product as advertised.",Positif
"Samsung makes the best displays on the market, and I love almost everything about this phone... except the display. The picture quality is excellent, but these curved edges and rounded display corners have got to go.

Regarding the curved edges - they have no functional propose that couldn't be achieved with a flat screen. No matter how you hold the phone you'll get glare at one edges or the other. Images and text message the edge get distorted. On-screen buttons at the edge are problematic at best. The curved edges make it virtually impossible for a case to properly protect the phone if dropped.

The rounded display corners are ridiculous. In many apps it really makes no difference, but in some there's just content you can't see. Ironically, the claimed display size of 5.8"" is measured as if the corners were not rounded.

The fingerprint sensor placement is poor (though common). If the phone is face up on a table I must pick it up to unlock it (or position my face directly above the screen for other biometrics).

Everything else is great: performance, responsiveness, display quality, battery life - all the things you'd normally expect from a flagship device. But these other bizarre design choices are baffling.",Negatif

"I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S9 back in March from Samsung.com.
My first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged S7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. Calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles. They couldn't even provide the IMEI of the returned device to prove it was even the one that I sent to them.
I went to sell my Samsung Galaxy S9 because I was so mad from this experience. I sold the phones that should have been unlocked since I paid full price for the phones. But the phones were locked to T-Mobile and T-Mobile couldn't unlock them. I called Samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles. I asked the reps why they would send me a phone I paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone.

"I purchased this phone some months ago and was extremely excited to try it out. It arrived perfectly with all the parts and pieces it was supposed to come with and for the first two months I was completely satisfied with my purchase. I'd also took measures and purchased a heavy duty phone case and a screen protector to make sure this puppy lasted me a while. However, two months in, my phone started unexpectedly freezing and the battery life was starting to decline rapidly. I had only used 18 of the 64 GB available but I took the time to clean out my storage and any unnecessary files anyways in hopes that the phone's behavior would improve. To my surprise, its performance was rapidly declining more and more by the days. Not long after it got to the point where my phone screen would randomly turn itself off and not turn back on. The phone would vibrate like it would when it was on when I'd press the home button but the screen would not light up. It would do this multiple times a day and I would have to manually soft reset it every single time. I reached out to Samsung support and was not able to receive any help or answers from them. By this point my 30-day warranty had already expired and Amazon would no longer be able to exchange the phone for me. I wish I had just spent a few dollars extra to make sure that I had received a reliable phone. Very unsatisfied",Negatif

"Before I start I need to say that I came from a Windows 10 phone and a flawless working mobile platform. However, after a long time using Windows phone it's clear that a Android phone is quite a shock, because everything is on your shoulders to get it customized/optimized. Regardless of this, my biggest contra is on battery life. This is unbelievable, max 12-14hr if you use WIFI, this is not top. My last Alcatel Idol 4s Windows phone last forever comparing to Samsung Galaxy S9+. The good thing is, you can customize and make it more ""Microsoft like"", Microsoft applications including Office, OneDrive, Cortana and Outlook do not come preinstalled, but when you can personalize the device with Microsoft's productivity applications so every customer is able to work, play and connect on their device when they leave. The design is nice, the camera pretty awesome, took some test photo's and they look great. To install everything and import stuff such as text and/or MMS messages take time (and additional tools). Without customization the default installation made the phone super ""wordi"", just sending from every app messages etc. So, I recommend to check this first to fulfill your needs. The screen is stunning, clear picture. And it's good to see, Samsung is catching up with former Microsoft Hello technology to have fingerprint, iris, face recognition. Thats a very good feature which is also used in additional apps such as banking. I'm also concerned about IP68 (water protection) because there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micro sd card from water.

And yet I have a button for it that I can't remap. Guess what I can do?disable it. Yup. A dead button is better to Samsung than a button I can use on my almost $1k phone. The update speed is one of the worst of any brand of Android phone manufacturers. I switched carriers so I don't get OTA updates. I was told that Samsung switch would work. So no big deal right? It doesn't. It says my phones are up to date and it's 2 months behind in security patches. My S7 active was on nougat when oreo was out and it said I was up to date. Samsung's solution? Visit a Best buy store every month to get the update. GTFO. The hardware is awesome. Wonderful camera. Amazing screen. Long lasting battery. But that software is trash. Complete trash.

"Received the product on time, however there were no accessories, on further inspection the phone was fake. All accessories were in Chinese, it felt like only a weight was inside the device . The back of the device only had stickers for the camera, led and fingerprint reader. Just casually looking on the device you won't be able to tell, but once you actually touch it you can feel it.

Amazon Customer service was extremely understanding and helpful and quickly processed my oder and I was able to get the black version which I am happy with now.",Negatif
"This is a typical Samsung Flagship phone. It is well built and feels premium on hand. The picture quality is great. Shoots even better in low light.

But slowly I started playing with them. Definitely useful but not must have.

Why did I give 3 stars?
Too much Samsung bloatware and the Bixby button is hell of annoying. The fingerprint and face recognition are not reliable. Face recognition rare works. The phone battery tends to die over night in standby mode if I only have 10% left.",Positif

I have now had my s9 for 4 months and it is starting to go down the same path. The worse part is I try to refuse the updates but now Samsung forces them upon you. I contacted them for help and all they said was we recommend you do them and then nothing more. I bought an Android because I thought I would have freedom of software use and to refuse updates, that is no longer the case. Next phone will be an apple iPhone where you can refuse updates and they have better privacy protection.",Negatif

"I had a Galaxy S7 ans Iphone 8 and purchased both a Galaxy S9 and S9+ ... The camera on the Samsung destroys all of Apple's product offerings. That was one of the main reasons in getting the phone. I still think the Apple OS is far superior to Android, and there are glitches galore. turned off all notifications but still can get an app or two which will notify even when do not disturb is put on. Here is the odd thing, the S9 that I have seems to preform much faster and have a better camera than the s9+ on several occasions I used both and there was a huge difference in speed and pic quality. I would take the S9 over the S9+ screen seems sharper and the larger size is not worth is, horrible Bixby feature! My Galaxy S7 made me a Samsung Customer, the S9 is making the Apple 8 seem more appealing and I prefer the aspect ratio of the screen on the apple. Speakers are better on the Galaxy.

"Like many products these days it's all about the marketing and hype. I've had the phone now for over a month.

Pros:
Speakers are loud and clear
Headphone amp is 1.4x more powerful
Some interesting tweaks in audio for Dolby Atmos, tube amp, etc.
Display is outstanding

Cons:
Bixby button is an annoyance. The placement is such when you use the power button you hit the Bixby button which IMO is a useless feature.
Samsung bloatware. Knox, Samsung music, gallery, etc. Compared to Google and what's on play I just want to delete them but can't.
OS updates! The half-hearted joke is if you want an updated OS, buy a new phone. This includes security updates.
Samsung should concentrate their efforts on updating the OS and security and forgo the lousy Samsung apps.

Would I recommend the phone. That depends. If you love audio, then yes this is a good choice. If you want updated software, speed and smooth opertation I would look elsewhere.",Positif

"When I first bought the Galaxy S9 (thru Xfinity Mobile), I was very much impressed with its graphics, camera, and just overall sleek design. The OS is very responsive and easily adaptable. And for its price, I find it to be a great quality phone. Unfortunately, if I couldve done things differently, I would've bought an S8. It seems, that as a new model, there are still kinks that Samsung needs to work out.

The battery is VERY WEAK. It doesn't even last half a day (12 hours) with moderate use. Also, the design can sometimes make the phone screen very easily crackable because of the raised edges (the phone case that I had bought could not protect the phone when it fell to the ground).",Positif

I bought my galaxy s9 weeks ago and the battery last less than 12hours they said is new but im not sure about it...... i want my money back!!!,Negatif
"Lets start with the positives. It's fast, its responsive, the camera is good, ample storage and USB-C. Also has a headphone jack which is sadly scarce in 2018

Now the negatives. The biggest one is the rounded edges of the display (and the reason why I will probably be selling this phone). they make it impossible to hold the phone with one hand, as it will ALWAYS detect your palm as an imput and mess up the touch sensors. It also gives a warping effect for any video being watched, so the edges are always deformed. Also this screen scratches way too easy, I have only had it since April and the screen is already scratched to the point where its intrusive. Had a note 5 since launch day and it had not a single scratch on the screen, vs this which was getting scratches within a few days of getting it.
Now lets talk about bixby and the bixby button. Bixby is a waste of space, as the original siri worked better. Not to mention google assistant also is on the device, which works a lot better. Now when I tried to bind google assistant to the bixby button, but this is the next issue, you can't remap the DEDICATED HARDWARE BUTTON. I thought samsung would of learned from the S8 reviews, but I guess they didn't. Don't worry, they made it to where you're able to ""disable the bixby button"" where basically it puts it on a 3 second press rather than a tap, and otherwise remains active.

Now for just some things that don't classify as ""negatives"" but I just personally don't like. The 18:9 or properly called 2:1 just seems weird, and it pushes the top buttons a little too high for convenient use I have decently large hands but still finding myself straining my thumb to hit drop down menus or open notifications. Also 99% of video content is 16:9 or 21:9, making 18:9 weird for both
I also prefer the dedicated hardware buttons of the older galaxies, as you either hide them, which means in order to have a home button you need to swipe up. It is always popping up rather than having me scroll when I swipe up, which gets incredibly annoying extremely quickly. The other option is to lock the buttons to the screen, which just makes no sense, as not only do you waste battery powering them (since they are white with a light gray background), but you also get burn-in since its an oled display. Also at that point whats the point in onscreen buttons, you could just have physical buttons that work better and allow front fingerprint scanners.

All in all there are some very strong positives about the phone, but they get completely outweighed by the negatives imo.",Negatif

Calling Amazon was a bit interesting because they had me on hold for about 40 minutes. Buyer beaware you may pay $700 for a fake. I requested a replacement which should arrive shortly. I will video the opening and recommend you do you just in case this happens to you. Will update my review on the replacements arrival.",Negatif

"I got this as a replacement for two S7 Edges that I had to return. I figured it'd make sense to try for a fancy new phone, seeing as it has been many moons since I've had an actual brand new phone. I was deciding between this and the OnePlus 5, but this came with a bunch of free stuff and I have had major issues with getting support for products that aren't sold or supported by my wireless carrier, plus the OnePlus had a couple of weird compatibility issues that I wasn't as much of fan of.

Pros and cons here:

+ Amazing camera-- performs great in low light, much faster than previous models, and some fun new features.
+ Fast processor. Fast fingerprint sensor and many more options for unlocking that I haven't tried yet.
+ Much faster startup than S7 Edge.
+ Excellent battery life. I can go through the whole day without worrying about running out of power, which is great, because now I have to buy all new freaking USB-C chargers, because capitalism.

- Bixby is truly horrendous-- would rather not have anything at all than a built-in personal assistant that is completely useless, doesn't understand basic speech, and can't really do anything. ""Bixby, is there a hardware store around here?"" ""Let me see... do you want to call John Doe?"" Made worse by the fact that Samsung has attempted to needlessly gamify the Bixby concept, so you get experience points when you talk to it.
- Samsung tells me that the voice-to-text that they use in the Samsung keyboard is the same as the Bixby voice recognition, which is effectively useless. It misses every other word and mistranslates most words. I had very few issues with my S6, S7, or BlackBerry Q10 before that.
- Fingerprint sensor is mildly frustrating on the back but you do get used to it.
- Lack of a home key is sometimes unreliable for full-screen applications.
- Some issues with unreliable full-screen/split-screen performance within specific software. I've had this issue only with YouTube and Google Maps, but it's frustrating.
- Battery, while taking a long time to get to 5%, will die almost immediately as soon as it hits, say, 3 or 4%. I know this is a question of software rather than hardware as far as how they display it, but my S6 and S7 were much more accurate in terms of how much life was actually left. It is the difference between having to run to a charger to ensure that your phone doesn't turn off in the middle of doing something and, well, keeping it on.
- Takes FOREVER to charge with the OEM charger-- a couple of hours to a full charge and no quick charging on the factory OEM charger. Sometimes won't charge at all with lower-ampacity chargers, which is an obnoxious design flaw of planned obsolescence slash idiocy.
- Some software issues that I didn't have on the S7 and S6 including with Netflix, some radio streaming apps, Facebook, and odds and ends with a couple of other things. I'm used to these things taking several months to get resolved.
- I've had some charging issues that no one, including Samsung, Amazon, or T-Mobile, will propose resolving other than to replace my device. This is the third replacement phone I've tried to get for my S6 Edge, whose battery life started to wane to the point of being totally unusable after a couple of years. It's extremely frustrating to deal with this.

I will revise my review in another couple of months-- will see how it goes.",Positif

"Just google s9+ poor phone reception and you will see what I'm dealing with. Brand new phone, bought on this link on prime day. Would not recommend or buy again, ever. Last samsung phone, that's certain. Unfortunately, reliability has been declining with each new model samsung phone and I made a mistake ""upgrading"" my s7 edge. Fortunately, I still have my s7. The rating for this phone is undeserving, should be around 3 stars at best. Bixby is the most annoying thing ever and I miss the home button. Cool phone if you have hours to burn tinkering with it to get it to function. WIFI calling on VERIZON will NOT work with this unlocked us version phone. Cool fact to find out AFTER purchase. 2 stars because it's pretty. Also, difficult to use one handed vs the s7 edge. Final verdict: JUNK.

"I recently traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for my new S9 Plus. HUGE mistake. Bixby is the absolute worst voice assistance program I have every used. Understands me about 10% of the time. Works ok with Bixby button, but voice wake up (Hi Bixby) will not work. I've reset, uninstalled app, and uninstalled updates. No luck. Luckily, OK Google works perfectly. I definitely recommend disabling Samsung Voice service from your keyboard settings. Voice transcription is horrible. Google Voice Service seems to work almost flawlessly. Also, I do not care for the camera. Compared to my iPhone, the photos taken in ""Live Zoom"" mode are too oversaturated and blurry. Everything appears to have an orange glare.The keyboard is also terrible. Auto correct never works, auto-capitalization fails to capitalize my ""I's."" I love the screen, the themes, and Especially love Samsung Pay, but I miss my iPhone.",Negatif
I'm not sure if it was just the phone or if the S9 actually isn't as good as I thought it would be.. I'm thinking it was the phone because I upgraded to the S9 plus and am now absolutely in love with it. I did order this one 1st though and had a lot of trouble with the voice to text. Actually texting was really hard in general too. That made it kind of a bummer to play around on because I use voice command a LOT. I decided to return it and just got my refund.. I am so thankful I was able to get that at least!! That's the only reason I rated at 3 stars instead of only two.,Positif

It's nearly impossible to change the artery on the S9, therefore, I will need to buy an entirely new phone in the next year or two. But that's not why I'm giving this phone (and Samsung) one star. The microphone stopped working, so no one can hear me when I call them. From what I have read, this is a major issue which Samsing has failed to address. I tried all fixes to no avail, to include restoring the phone to its factory settings. Very frustrating for an almost $800 phone, which is not a paperweight.

"I got this phone last month to replace my old iPhone, as I was tired of Apple for a variety of reasons.

I checked everywhere and no one has an answer on how to fix that. Then the camera started freezing. It wouldn't go from selfie to portrait nor from camera to gallery without needing a restart. I now just left Samsung's flagship shop in London to find out what to do. Turns out my ONLY choice is to send it back to America and hope for the best.

There are also major software problems too: the VPN simply refused to function after switched from Wi-Fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the VPN. My office has several Wi-Fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. Samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem.

Now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the S8, I don't even see the stuttering in the Google Play Store, that's how smooth the phone is.

Overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with VPN according to Samsung, so I decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it. Guess I would use the S8 one more year.",Positif
"Clearly I am not a Samsung fanboy. I purchased an S6 that I was unhappy with. The amount of ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software was incredible. The phone's performance was at best lackluster. I traded it in after a few months. Then the S9 came out with much fanfare and reviews that often put ahead of anything else. It's as bad or worse than the S6. Yes performance is way ahead, but the ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software is worse than ever.The touch screen seems ultra sensitive at the edge, but try touching in the middle. It's hit or miss, even with the sensitivity set to believe I have a screen protector which I don't. Opening the screen sometimes reveals the home page, sometimes it is some other random thing from an app. Then there's ""butt dials"" that I'm not sure are truly butt dials as I have had more in 3 months than I have had in in total over the last 3 years! While on that subject, I an be walking around with my phone in my pocket and it suddenly starts playing music. The local Verizon store has attempted to resolve many of these issues without success. They have offered to replace the phone, but the one that they sent me was ""refurbished"" and had many scratches on the screen-light but still scratches. I refused it. All this makes me wonder how the reviews could be so positive. Farewell Samsung.",Negatif
"Back in March, I switched from an LG V20 to the S9+ because the screen on my LG began to bleed through. Big mistake. The Samsung pales in comparison to the LG. There's no tap or knock to wake option, the fingerprint sensor is finicky, scrolling through social media is a chore and I found myself growing more and more aggravated with daily use. In short, I paid the phone off early. When I was in the store explaining at how dissatisfied I was with the phone, a Samsung representative was present. Upon overhearing my gripes, he just said something about not pleasing everyone. While that's true and there is no perfect phone, Samsung sure has some catching up to do with LG. Much better User Interface on LG and the fingerprint sensor isn't as finicky. Do yourself a favor and check out the V30 or the G7. Skip the S9+",Negatif
"I like the size. I like the image quality. I like its performance. I like the way it looked, before....
I dont like how fragile the screen is.
One drop from just waste height and the corner of the screen is scratched and cracked. I see no way of getting it repaired or replaced by the seller on Amazon. No durability warranty, I guess.",Positif

"The battery life was shorter than a new phone. The phone itself was fine but the description was misleading as #1 the ""US Warranty"" stated in the title is void when reselling a used phone. It also states, ""Accessories may have cosmetic damage"" this was false as well because the original items were completely replaced by generic headphones and power cord. You will not receive what was promised unless you buy a new phone, which I had to do. I had to return this item, and am still waiting for my refund.",Negatif
"Do NOT buy an S9 if you use T-Mo and plan to go overseas. Samsung has a very bad pop-up message that wants you to switch out of roaming, but you need to be in roaming when traveling with T-Mo. The pop-up can't be disabled and opens about 50 times a day. This has been a known issue since November 2017 and Samsung hasn't done anything about it.",Negatif
"I received this phone and out of the box, I felt it would be a hard phone to keep a hold of if your hands are damp. I also had some issues within the on screen keyboard. I did like the fact that you could tel the phone to play a notification tone while on a call. I also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones.

The phone also has some other things I just can't live with. The phone would play a notification tone whenever I would connect an Bluetooth keyboard and or a hard wired keyboard to it. I couldn't find a way to turn that off. I contacted Samsung and they told me that is just the way the phone works and there wasn't a way to turn that off. US customer service from Samsung in my thoughts is lacking at best.

I also got the Notification tones when I turned on/off the Voice Assistant for blind people to use the phone. Thhen on top of that, when using the voice assistant, I couldn't get the caller ID to repete it would only say it once and that was it. I tried quite a few caller ID programs and none of them worked when using a Bluetooth headset to get the caller ID to speak every 5 seconds or so. Without a headset connected by Bluetooth, they worked.

The finger commands for there voice assistant for the most part don't work while on a call. Example: if I'm not on a call with voice assistant running, I could triple tap with two fingers and get status information like for time, network, WiFi etc... While on a call it says nothing. Same way with a lot of the other commands they don't work.

To me for a blind person, I would stay away from this phone as the way it currently is.",Negatif

Worst phone I have ever used. Samsung took a fully functional operating system and stripped out all the good features to replace them with Samsung services that require another login.

I'm constantly having buffering issues I never had with my Nexus 5x. This happens on cell network or wifi.,Negatif

The iPhone always worked though. The s9+ is a constant fight to get something to work how I want it. The apps don't run nearly as smooth as they did on the iPhone. On a positive note, it's got a nice camera. This phone is a great piece of hardware with terrible software. I'm excited for my one year lease to expire so I can get another iPhone.",Negatif
It's not even fully unlocked because I can't have Verizon as my carrier. I'm lowkey mad. Refund time!,Negatif
"I bought the S9 directly from Samsung.com, and wow was that a huge mistake. I got the phone, switched over my service with Verizon and sent the old phone off for credit. The next day I noticed the S9 had some minor physical damage from shipping. I was going to let it slide but thought, nah, I just bought this thing, its on them to fix it.

Samsung refuses to do anything but a refund for sending back the phone. I cant be without a phone, my business depends on me talking to clients. I asked them to send me a new one and ill return the defective one once i switch my service over. They refuse.

I'm blown away. Had I bought the phone from Amazon, Best Buy or, hell, even Verizon, they would have given me that option. I tried talking to managers, I tried using chat, email, nothing works.

The phone itself inst bad, but Samsung customer service is disgusting. This is coming from a guy who has their 75"" QLED TV, Family Hub Smart Fridge, touchscreen washer and dryer, and literally everything else Samsung offers.

You lost a customer for life, and i loved you guys. What a sad way to go.",Negatif

I booted in SAFE mode and even attempted to do a factory reset. The phone is in an endless boot cycle. I've found that getting it serviced is a challenge. Verizon couldn't help me, Calling Samsung directly couldn't help me.... they've told me to contact Amazon directly which I'm about to do.

It's pretty obvious that the market couldn't sustain quality issues like this, so I think I got a lemon.",Negatif
"Great phone, three stars because I am comparing it to a phone that is less than half the cost with close performance. Look at the ZTE Axon 7 and you will find a lesser camera, but not by much plus stereo speakers and a solid build. I returned it because it is so much more than the ZTE and only offers modest upgrades in comparison. That being said, the phone itself is beautiful and well made with lots of great features, but the price point is the killer based on its mild competition. This is all my opinion for my needs an economic philosophy and I mean no disrespect to Samsung. It's just too much money for what else is out there at this time.",Positif
"With use of a case, the phone cannot sustain a fall of 42 inches. The glass will crack.
If you don't want to pay for half the phone to fix small cracks, you can try repairing it yourself and break all internal components, when you fail, Samsung will refuse to repair it, even though you are offering them money.

"The Galaxy S9 is a great looking and working phone, but I challenge you to try to figure out all the camera features they show in the commercial.

They show all sorts of things like 'swing' and 'boomerang' and 'super slo-mo', but the only feature I can actually find is the slo-mo. The other features are buried somewhere in the camera and Samsung provides ZERO instructions on how to use them.

I'm currently scouring the internet to see how to activate these features, but it is a major fail for Samsung for not providing guidance in the box.",Positif
"The phone is good but not a great. First the curved screen is annoying if you use the phone without a case because touching these edges by mistake will block the other parts inputs plus the edges are more light reflective than the middle part so watching a movie on the gym or bright place is annoying. The second problem is that, we are in 2018 and I still don't get it why Samsung still hasn't added the "" Screen turns on by notification"" feature yet when 99% of the phones today have this feature. Lastly, the power save on the phone is still bad, If someone is new to Samsung will not know he or she needs to turn off the battery saving mode on some apps such as Gmail and Yahoo mail, or their E-mails will be arrived late.",Positif
"This phone surpasses any iPhone currently and previously on the market. I bought it as a second phone just to use for posting pictures for my real estate business.

The note 7 (which I also owned) blew up and this one just dies after 30 minutes of use. If you can charge it for three hours to use the camera it a great.. other than that you get a ""battery too low to use flash"" message.

Yes, friends it happens much easier than it should. We had the same issue with the S8 and the S9. It was dropped from a reasonable height (between knee and hip - the exact height you will carry and use it at) and both the S8 and S9 shattered.
The worst part is that Samsung refuses to cover the screen under their ""warranty.""
The local shop they sent us to did fix the 9 for about $100 less than the S8 (total was $235 for the S9 fix). Also, remember this phone just came out, we've had it less than two months. The shop said they already had 20+ people in with broken S9 screens.

I was much, much happier until (lo and behold) I received an S9+ as a gift. Now I use the S9+ just so I won't hurt someone's feelings. Karma better remember this.
BTW, who was the idiot that placed the fingerprint sensor right underneath the camera lenses? You always wind up smudging them when you scan your print.

"Fast, packed with customization, beautiful pictures. Occasionally I trigger the edges when I use it in landscape mode but that's not too big of a deal. I wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby. Even though I have an app that controls bixby, I still see bixby being triggered slightly before the new intended shortcut is triggered. If you're going to use a work profile on here, be warned that depending on your place of work you will not be able to use custom keyboards (understandably so). It's just a bit confusing when my s7 allowed the use of custom keyboards and the s9+ will not (both phones were used for the same job, don't know why the standards are different). Great phone, I'm glad I bought it and am having a better experience with it than the phones I've owned previously (Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy s7, Nexus 7, Pixel XL, Moto X).

Lowering the rating for this. It's only been a few months but I'm already starting to have battery issues. I went from not managing my battery too much to constantly needing to charge and top off my phone. I've started to have a strange charging issue where my phone won't fast charge even though its reporting that its doing so. The only charger that I've found to somewhat efficiently charge my phone is an unmarked charger I got from work. Otherwise it takes forever to charge even to 70%. I have yet to contact a Samsung service center but will am afraid I'll need to. I've tried ever trouble shooting method short of master resetting my phone. After experiencing these issues with the s7 a while back I'm thinking I might go away from the galaxy line at this point. Will report back if I'm able to fix the issue, such a pain.",Negatif

You can get along with the Android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when I tried to backup the photos I took in my Macbook.

Actually I have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my Mac.

After trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an SD card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a Macbook was a big NO for me.

"S9 could be a wonderful phone but the OS sucks at this point. Phone OS traps you in delete mode for both messages and email, only way out is shutting the phone down and repowering up, at least once a day. Additionally phone comes bloated with google everything with permissions for way too much. Settings are multi layered and manual is useless, eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs, if you do not it is setup to eat battery power, and data at amazingly high rates.

"They had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable �features�. Another forced Bixby (it insists upon itself). I have both this and the iPhone X. Surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (SPOILER ALERT: iPhone). I was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the S8+. It�s at least as laggy as the last phone. It�s not worth the price, flagship or not. If you�re OS agnostic, get an iPhone. This is way more trouble than it�s worth. It arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.

Also, in typical Android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. Every app you install makes the phone that much slower. This is an Android problem, same thing happens on the Pixel 2 XL. I should have stuck with the Pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.

"After years of not using Samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, I finally gave it a shot with the S9 Plus. Unfortunately, I had to return the device next day.

THE GOOD:

Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life.

Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :)

The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.

THE ""DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING"":

Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity?

Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!

Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone.

Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense!

As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it.

THE BAD:

The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess.

Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem.

Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.",Positif
"Recently upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week, I decided to upgrade from a Samsung S7 to a Samsung S9+. I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time.

Rarely have I been so disappointed in a tech purchase! And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include ""Bixby,"" microphone placement, and voice recognition.

First, the ""Bixby"" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.

Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.

Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone ""hears"" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. I spend 50-60 hours per week driving and MUST be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.

Swing and a resounding miss, Samsung.",Negatif
Just wanted to comment that the battery life is terrible. Samsung has had several years to correct the battery issue and has yet to do so.,Positif
The Galaxy S9 is an amazing phone.... BUT.... the unlocked version on Amazon is NOT compatible with Verizon. I took it to three different stores to make sure it was the phone and not Verizon.,Positif
I recieved the wrong color. :(,Negatif
"Phone stopped working right within a month. Called Samsung, guy told me my phone would be replaced within a week when I sent it in. It took two weeks, they didn't replace the phone, instead they ""fixed"" my phone. It now is worst than before. They also damaged the exterior of my phone and kept my accessories. Only solution they keep offering is top send it in yet again to be fixed. No matter how many times I send it in, they will not replace the phone. (that's per a man speaking on behalf of the president of samsung)",Negatif
"I had the S8 and screens were slipping and sliding/opening and closing. That was resolved either with an update or one of many calls to Verizon (don't recall.) Also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning. My boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and I could hear much better. But I had already ordered the S9 since I didn't think we could fix the audio on the S8. I'm having so many issues with it. I was on the phone with Verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. After exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that I got a defective phone! What are the odds? When I try to google, email or text, I get knocked out into home screen. Very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text. Perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. It's not the apps - we put it in Safe Mode. We changed everything around including Samsung keyboard to Gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. I'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review. Aren't I the lucky one? I think I'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone. New phone arriving tomorrow and will go to Verizon store for set up as I did with this phone. Wish me luck please! Thanks.",Negatif
"I just got this phone through my work. I've owned the Galaxy 4,5, and 7, so I figured I'd stay with the same brand and get the S9. I've had it only a few days, and the screen is so unresponsive when clicking and scrolling and apps are spontaneously shutting down.

I do love the creativity behind this and camera features, but getting the darn thing to work is quite frustrating.",Negatif
"I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.
I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me.
Decided to try S9 due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are always there, making that 5"" screen more like 4.5"", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense..

Anyway, S9 notifications:

No notifications on locked screen: I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.

Limited notifications on locked screen:
Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.

Raise to wakeup and show notifications:
With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing notifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...

Notifications while using the phone:
Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.
All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ?

App Icon number:
Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few.

Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications in Settings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different. Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got. Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung...

All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications.

Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ? Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, and rarely nail a single one.

First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.
Second crazy option: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ?
Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one...
Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification.

I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen; Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.
In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9. Duh..

And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.

All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9.

Some notable positive sides:
Samsung Internet browser is just awesome.
LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-, to ""help"" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one.
Starting camera with double click to Power button.
Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.
Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.
Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7.

UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification:
Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues:
1. Some people actually LIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.
2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.
3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.
3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings - ""Wake Up screen on Notifications"". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option.
4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.
I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...",Negatif
"OK, I looked at my old S6 and decided it was time for a new phone, the S9 has better security,
a slot to expand memory, newer camera and a Bixby assistant if your to lazy to press app.
What it doesn't have is an IR Blaster so I can use it as a remote. The upgrades I didn't need
are there, the one additional item I liked they removed. This is an expensive downgrade for me.",Positif
