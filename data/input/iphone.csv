"TLDR: Great phone, looks new. Pay attention to who the seller is when you make your choice - the seller changes when you choose a different color. I bought from BuySPRY.

All good so far. I was incredibly hesitant to buy a refurbished phone on Amazon after reading so many negative reviews on various products. I spent a lot of time researching my options and figured this one was probably my safest bet. Phone came in perfect condition (seriously, it looks brand new) and so far all the functions seem great. Set up was easy, unlocked, ready to set my fingerprint and everything. It's fast, sleek, and beautiful. Camera and audio are also great.

What I learned: who the seller is is very important.
Although all the phones on here are iPhone 6S 64GB, when you select a different color, the seller changes. When you scroll down and look at the section ""Compare to similar items"", you will see who the phone is sold by. Looking at the reviews, most of the negative reviews seemed to be associated with the Space Gray more than the other colors. I then looked rating of each seller for each color of the iPhone 6S 64GB and went from there.

As of the time of this review, the Space Gray is listed as ""Item Under Review"" because of the customer feedback.",Positif
"Poor quality control. It was wiped, but was still registered to the prior owner. I contacted the seller (Breed), and they would not replace for another unit. I would not trust this seller.",Negatif
"Worst experience I've had on Amazon, through the seller ELECTRONIC DEALS..
Upon receiving the phone and inspecting it, I noticed small pieces of rubber protruding out of the edges of the phone, as if the phone had been forced together pinching off the excess rubber that was packed inside. I also notice a clouding of the camera lens as well as the yellowing of the flash. The cosmetic look of the phone did not bother me too much as long as it did not affect any of the phones functions, however I was mistake; the phone functioned horribly as well.
After using the phone in noticed a number of problems:
- the sensitivity of the touchscreen was off, i would try to backspace and it would sense i was pressing 'g', which was no where near each other.
- the phone would randomly start opening apps after apps without even touching the phone, and would constantly tap in the corners or the middle of the screen for a couple of minutes randomly. example: i would be texting, then suddenly the phone would start spamming 'fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff' for a short period of time. the click on the persons contact, and open other screens, even calling sometimes. The most frustrating instance was when i opened my GPS, it would constantly change my route, or even choose another location. It was a constant fight of inputting the correct location into the map multiple time throughout my drive. It was a very dangerous experience that could possible have cause serious injury on the road...
- the screen would constantly be unresponsive, causing me to lock the phone, then unlocking the phone. Repeating each time
- the camera would not focus on anything in close proximity, and words on a document.

I've never been so disappointed in an Amazon purchase before. Quality Control is crap",Negatif
"The product was defective and I wish I had chosen another retailer. It's not too late for you.

1. DEFECTIVE BATTERY - The phone was defective the day it arrived. The battery does not hold a charge consistently or indicate how long it will actually last. This defect is sporadic—so sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I thought I was doing something wrong at first so, after a few weeks of frustration, I did a test to see: tracking how long I charged and how long it lasted. This confirmed it was not my fault or a defective charger and that the phone I purchased from Electonic Deals was the problem.

2. QUESTIONABLE SECURITY - Since the day it arrived, I've had someone trying 'access the phone' remotely who is not me. I have never experienced this when I purchased a new phone or one from a credible phone reseller.

3. DEFECTIVE CAMERA - The camera stopped working entirely with no clear cause as I did not drop or damage it in any way prior to this malfunction (however, to be honest, I did scratch it in the corner but this was ironically just last week).

All these problems lead to some unfortunate experiences. An unreliable phone can leave you stranded in dangerous situations: Once I charged the phone all day at work, and left late at night so I called a cab. The Electonic Deals phone died by the time I was outside, leaving me locked out and stranded. The cab never came and I had to walk through the city by myself at midnight. It can also risk your job: I had a 100% charge before going to bed so I did not plug it in to charge (reasonable) and it died before the morning so my alarm did not ring. I was late to work several times because of this and ended up buying an old alarm clock.

Why didn't I send it back immediately?
- Initially, I was not sure the battery issue was a defect. I tend to trust sellers and waited to verify this before accusing Electronic Deals of making a bad sale.
- The requests to access my info made me not trust sending it back. Maybe it was Electonic Deals and, if I sent the phone back, I would be at risk of identity theft. I still don't trust this and will bring it to a techy friend to clear my data...
- A cell phone is no small purchase. The time between returning it, receiving my money back, and purchasing a new one would leave me disconnected and out 1K.
- Once I did confirm this, I had come up with a system: use it only when needed, carry an external battery and always have it plugged in when at work, home and near a power source. Ignore the requests from the mysterious person and hope for the best. Once the camera died, it was very doomed and clear I had been swindled by Electonic Deal.

Note: After many emails, the company eventually said I could return the phone— however, they included terms that essentially negated the offer to take it back. Maybe the return terms were a mistake and they will send me my money back in full. However, I've received no gestures of good faith or indication that they sell working products or do fair business. I may have to take the $500 loss because it was my choice to test instead of returning immediately. So my advice is to pick another seller and, if you run into ANY issue, RETURN THE ELECTRONIC DEALS PRODUCT IMMEDIATELY. Rate them 1 star.

As of this point, I do not trust them and don't think you should either.

Also, if you have suggestions for another more credible retailer please share it with me in the comments so I can find a new working phone!",Negatif
"7/6/17
Just received my phone today! As far so good! Attached are the pictures of what I received in my package, only thing not pictured was the metal tool to pop out the SIM card tray. Overall very pleased with what I received!",Positif
"So I purchased two phones from these guys, noting mostly positive reviews from their previous customers. Both arrived in really good shape and appeared to work properly. However, while one of them has had no issues, the other one has had intermittent reception issues and now will not hold a charge. Clearly the device has some problems and now needs a new battery. I purchased these less than 6 months ago and got Square Trade warranties, which unfortunately do not cover battery replacement. The seller only offers a very conditional 90 day warranty. The moral of this story? Sometimes you get a good phone and sometimes you get a piece of junk. Buyers beware!",Negatif
You're probably reading comments all paranoid like I did. Lol. This is a positive review. I LOVE IT. Looks brand new. Works fast and great. If you have any questions about my experience you can contact me at my Instagram @abenaasf,Positif
"This will be the 3rd iPhone 6s I have had to return for being defective! I am so sick of starting over with a new phone. Every iPhone was sold through Electronic Deals and this crap is unacceptable. I continue to purchase the same phone through the same vendor because i love the iPhone, it is priced reasonably and they are the lowest cost but this is not an option! I feel as though I should get some compensation for ALL my time and troubles! This iPhone is by far the worst yet, it freezes up and won’t open links it gets stuck on a letter or number and then won’t type it at all!!! Please make this next transction worth my while, say half price or better yet a complimentary iPhone wouldn’t hurt",Negatif
"1/20/17 UPDATE We took the phone to the apple store. It needed a software update. The phone works just fine. Customer service should suggest taking it to the apple store.) NOTE: Local repair shop wouldn't touch it. FIrst apple store wouldn't touch it because it is refurbished. Second apple store knew exactly what to do regardless of the fact it was refurbished.)

I purchased a the phone in July of 2017. 6 months later it doesn't turn on. I have taken good care of the phone. This was Breed's response. I was not looking for a return or refund and wanted them to replace the phone. A phone should last more than 6 months!

""We provide a warranty of 30 days to return an item for a refund or replacement. Unfortunately we are not able to authorize a return for your order since your warranty period has expired. We recommend taking the device to a local repair center...""",Negatif
"The device is not unlocked for international use, it is unlocked for only US network carriers, i had to pay $70 to get it working in My home country. overall the phone is awesome, its new and does not have any wear or scratches on it",Positif
"It was good and perfect for a week, and the battery died and it never turned back on, i am very disappointed i want a refund",Negatif
"Got this for my daughter as her first smart phone. Wasn't going to spend $400-500 on a phone, so went the factory refurbished route. It is a very nice phone, looks new to me. came with non-OEM charger and cable, but it works so who cares. no ear phones but that's ok. What I liked is the availability of a 1 year protection plan that popped up with I placed this phone in my cart - the protection plan offers don't pop up for all the phone choices so I would place one in my cart the delete it if the protection plan wasn't offered, repeated until I found one that did. All in all I think a good buy. Square Trade provides the protection plan. I used them for a Kindle several years ago and they did a great job replacing it after my son broke it.",Positif
"It was locked and under some one's contract with an unpaid bill.
I didn't like it - complete waste of time",Negatif
"So I thought I’d wait a bit after my purchase to make a review about this product because I know some things can happen later on and I didn’t want to regret rating incorrectly.

For starters, the product came exactly when it was supposed to. A+ for fast shipping. I was excited to receive my package but a little disappointed that they’d just left it in front of my door. It’s a good thing I was able to be home at the time and expecting it. I thought since it’s a phone, they’d want a sign off.

Anywho, after opening I started to inspect the phone. The screen and back appeared to have some white smudge marks on them (I still have no idea what they were) but I was able to clean it with an alcohol wipe. There also appeared to be something white completely covering the speakers and inside the charge port which put me off a bit. I became worried.

Since I’ve received the phone, the performance has been normal. No shutting off randomly, no bugging, nothing a phone shouldn’t be doing. It’s been performing completely normal as it should be and charging at a pretty good speed, especially since I use my phone for work and play. The only complaint I have there is the speakers, which don’t appear to sound very loud. Speaker phone doesn’t really help with that either. The camera works well and so does the flash. No worries there. The phone was unlocked as stated and I was able to immediately connect my phone service with it.

I haven’t dropped it yet (knocks on wood) & hopefully I won’t ever. The 6s has been my favorite version since it came out.

For the price of the phone, the overall of it is great. I would definitely recommend it to others and hopefully you’ll all get the most out of it. As for any iPhone, I also recommend purchasing a shockproof case at the same time of your phone purchase.

I hope my honest review helps any others looking to buy their phones online.",Positif
Phone came immediately. It was in excellent condition and included clear instructions on what to do if you needed to return the phone (time limits etc). I am very happy because I ordered a phone from another seller a few months back and The battery was shot and no matter what I do the shutter sound for the camera never turns off. This phone was perfect and I’ve had no problems so far.,Positif
"I brought my iPhone 6s from seller Chubbiestech. The only negative thing I would say was I ordered this phone with express 2 day shipping but I didn’t get in until my third day. I ordered the phone Wednesday expecting it to come Friday but it arrived Monday.

None the less, this phone is awesome. Just because I received this phone after 2 days late, the phone itself outweighs my only con. This phone was totally unlocked. The description says only GSM unlocked (AT&T and T-Mobile) but my Verizon prepaid service (CDMA) works perfectly fine with this phone. I thought I would have to switch my service but I’m glad I didn’t have to. It was very easy to set up and this phone damn near is brand new. There’s is only one little nic on the top gold part but when you put an case on it, it will hide it all.

This phone came with a generic usb charger, car charger price, phone case, sim opener, and my phone came with a screen protector already on.

I highly recommend buying from Chubbiestech.",Positif
"Pros
Phone arrived in excellent condition no visible damage at all and properly unlocked I’m on cricket mobile all I had to do was insert sim and go.

Cons
After 3 days of use phone shut off and would not turn back on without being fully charged. Upon turning phone received an error notification that battery could not maintain peek performance

Solution
Contacted seller to no avail.
Contacted Apple store and was informed based off of battery statistics that battery was faulty and needs to be replaced for 29.99
Scheduled maintenance for next week

Results
Will update after trip to Apple and verify true quality of the phone

Overall
Honestly it’s an inconvenience about the battery but even with the additional fee of replacing battery phone still comes in under 300 for a 64gb 6s I wish there was more clarity as to what certified refurbished means but all in all still satisfied with product though customer service may be a problem if your issue is major luckily my problem was only 30usd",Positif
"The phone lasts less than 12 hours after 20 minutes of talk, a handful of texts, and a small bit of web browsing. wifi and bluetooth are on. For comparison, with my old iphone 6, that's at least a year older than what this outfit sold me, in the same environment and settings, I get close to 24 hours. I contacted customer support and they said that's not a problem for them, they test only for it to last 10 hours. They offered return and refund, but this is wasting my time. I offered for them to instead pay for the $29 Apple battery replacement offer, but they declined. Considering that I'll replace the battery anyway if I get a different refurb'ed phone, I'll keep this one and get the battery replaced in a few weeks once I know the unit is otherwise working well, since MyWit support said if I have Apple replace the battery it'll void their warranty.",Positif
"I thought the phone was great until I started receiving phone calls. At first I thought it was the person on the line who's phone was messed up. After a few phone calls it was obvious the phone isn't working properly and all calls sound like the person is miles away, hard to hear them unless you put them on speaker phone. This was one of my fears of buying a ""certified refurbished"" product and unfortunately I was right.",Negatif
"Phone is in perfect cosmetic condition. No knicks, dings, or scratches. Screen is also perfect (no scratches, dead pixels, etc). Phone performs perfectly as well. Buying refurbished can be nerve wracking but this seller did not disappoint. Thank you!",Positif
"Not an iPhone fan at all. Horrible software. Limited features. And worst of all, horrible 3rd party app integration.

That being said, this phone (iPhone 6s a1688) works exactly as it is supposed to on Sprint once you take it to a company store (i.e., Sprint owned, not franchisee-owned), have them register the device's IMEI with the network, and insert a (free) 6s-specific SIM card, which you can pick up from an Apple store if the Sprint store doesn't have any on hand for such an old phone. All plan-supported features work as they are supported (LTE, Wi-Fi calling, mobile hotspot, &c.).

Purchased from seller MyWit. Arrived in like new condition with a long-lasting battery. No scuffs, scratches, &c. Buy with confidence from that seller, at least.",Positif
"The phone arrived with some crud around the camera lens - it was clear than no real care had been taken in giving the phone a quick clean before sending it off. I was prepared to let that go considering the price.
I powered up the phone and within 5 minutes it was roasting hot and the screen kept freezing. A full charge was down to 2% again within 20 minutes. I checked in settings for the phone info and found that the battery was old and seriously depleted. I had an email from the supplier asking if I was happy with the product. I replied explaining the situation and did not get any response whatsoever. Save yourself the hassle and don't bother. I would give zero stars if it was on option.",Negatif
"The phone is really great! I was worrying that the phone will have scratches or will be locked, BUT IT IS PERFECT! Perfect condition!",Positif
"My wife has been on a REALLY old phone (iPhone 4S!!!), so as an early Valentine's Day gift for her, I decided to get her this rose gold iPhone 6S-- she was really blown away by it!!! I bought the phone from Chubbiestech, they shipped it really fast! The phone is Certified Refurbished, but it basically looks and works as if it were a brand new phone!",Positif
"I have been a customer of Amazon's for 10 years. I'm pleased to say I have never had a poor experience from anything I've purchased. The exception to that being this refurbished cellphone. The phone I bought was actually quite nice, looked practically brand new. Issue was the battery barely lasted a day. But the REAL issue was the fact that even though it was unlocked and I had a SIM card I knew worked (because I took it out of my working Iphone 6) the phone would intermittently (at best) work with T-Mobile. It was show full service and LTE and then just no data or cell service. It would then go to 4G or 3G and then to no service. If I put it in airplane mode and then back out of airplane mode it would maybe start working.

THAT SAID, I figure, hey the package says to just call the third party that actually sold the phone for support. I did that 3 times and I also emailed them. Contrary to their claim DealFisher didn't care about my business or more importantly my satisfaction seeing I never got a call or email from them. I called T-Mobile and Amazon, both of which worked with me for about 30 minutes each trying to get the phone to work to no avail. I ended up packing up the phone and returning it and just bought a new phone from a friend. Long story short is I will NEVER trust a refurbished device again thanks to this experience and I will be very hesitant to use a third party seller on amazon again.

My recommendation to you is: amazon does have a great 90 day return policy so if you're trying to scrape by and get a pretty decent and new-like phone give it a shot, you might get lucky. I'd say have a CLOSE look at the seller's reviews and see if they seem to sell junk phones to lots of people. And my best advice, never purchase from DealFisher!",Negatif
"The phone seems pretty good, except that you would expect someone who refurbished a phone makes sure the battery is okay. My son is using this phone and he is lucky to get 3 hours of battery life. We will probably return it.

Update 4/19/18 --- We got the battery replaced and all is well now with the phone. However, the vendor (Dealfisher) refuses to cover the cost. It is something they should have made sure of before selling this phone. I do not recommend buying from this vendor.",Negatif
"This was a great way to buy a replacement iPhone 6S. Make sure you check the vendor: this was from BuySPRY who is a certified Amazon refurbished phone provider. The phone arrived in perfect condition inside a sturdy plastic box. The activation instructions were out of date, in that they insisted the phone be activated over Wifi when the iPhone itself refused to work without inserting a valid SIM card. Once I did that, activation proceeded as normal and the phone works perfectly. Great battery life too.",Positif
"This cellphone has a hardware problem. I reset it but still the same problem. The apps doesnt work, it shut downs spontaneously and sometimes it freezes and i have to reset the phone to make it work again. Doesn't work please I need you to contact me in order to solve this problem",Negatif
I complained about the battery (Because i have to charge it everyday at least 2 or 3 times) and the seller has done nothing about it.,Negatif
"First off all before I get to the phone the charger wasn't working, it was a third party charger that wasn't supported. And now the phone had scratches! (that I didn't mind) but when I I stared using it I realized that sensor isn't working! So the certified refurbished is just a lie it's a used broken item that someone sent back!",Negatif
Bought a new phone for my dad for fathers day! Even though it was pink only this seller had positive reviews and I didnt want to end up with a dud. Came right on time had to sign for it and in an iphone-esque box. All good i put it in a nice case and my dad was good to go! Works great no issues at all. Could see some wear and tear around the part where you charge and head phone insert but overall great job on the refurb!! Idk about other sellers but Chubbie is the truth. Ps i was not paid for this i shelled out over $200 of my own money.,Positif
"I cannot thank enough to people at Bluetek Intl. This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it a lot. The smartphone is in incredibly external shape, no noticeable scratches or dents, like a brand new device. It’s fully unlocked and it has been operating only for three days; so far battery lasts as supposed, compared to other iPhone 6S (64GB) and shows few charging cycles count. These smartphones tend to get warm to hot on the back when using cellular transmission module, but in this case that’s nothing different from my personal device which is brand new from my network operator. I’m considering to purchase a second IPhone 6S or SE from Bluetek Intl. I just would recommend customers of Refurbished Apple smartphone to invest in an original Apple power adapter and lightning cables as these devices are sort of “sensitive” and prone to fail when charged with aftermarket not certified power adapters.",Positif
"I’m not going to lie, I was terrified of ordering a refurbished phone from amazon especially with all the mixed reviews. However after reading through the reviews from one specific seller (BuySpry) I felt a little more confident! My phone came on time, with a little difficulty though, but that has more to do with FedEx than it has to do with the seller.... Anyways my phone looks as good as new, the quality is great and I was able to insert my sim with ease and no problems so I’m very happy! I would recommend ordering from BuySpry if possible... they have some of the best reviews I’ve seen as far as sellers go.... also be mindful when changing GB and color because the sellers change as well. Anyways I’m very pleased and happy I ordered!

.....

Okay, I’ve had this phone for little over a month now and I’ve realized that when I take photos, it always makes the shutter noise (even in silent mode). I’ve done some research and found out that this is because iPhones intended to be sold in certain countries dont allow you to turn off the noise, for privacy reasons. Tbh this is really annoying to me and bothersome, I have anxiety so to take pictures in silent places and have your camera shutter is like the worse for me. This isn’t to deter people from buying this phone but just be mindful that this might be a problem for you as well. However I still love my phone quite a lot and would still recommend!",Positif
"0 stars if I could.. first of all Amazon should not work with this seller which gives bad reputation to them. Phone came nice and clean but unable to turn on; apparently phone is dead and wont charge at all , not even the red battery or charging status showing. 5 hours charging and nothing. Charger does work because I tried it with other iphone.
Seller should have taken the time to test the phone prior to shipping it.
This bad experience makes me not to trust Amazon anymore",Negatif
"I have only had my phone for three months, and It broke. Brought it to the apple store and they told me it was because of whoever owned it before me. They damaged it cosmetically, which damaged it internally, thus breaking my phone after only owning it a few short months. I am very displeased because not only did I have to pay for a broken phone, but I also had to pay for its replacement. Very unhappy.",Negatif
"I received this phone to find the outer shell and screen in good condition. However, after I ran diagnostics on the battery, I was disappointed to find that it was not in healthy condition. The ""design capacity"" of the battery was at ~75% and had been cycled through over 400 complete charge cycles. All this to say, the battery was in a significantly used and degraded condition. If you order an Amazon Certified Refurbished phone, just keep in mind that it you may receive a phone/battery in similar condition.",Negatif
"We got this phone for our daughter for Christmas. I have the Plus version and am very happy with both. If you're familiar with Apple products, it works just like the others.",Positif
"The phone is great. The battery is poor. After using this certified refurbished phone for less than a month, the batter performance which was not great when I got the phone continued to degrade. To me refurbished should mean that the battery is new or is performing close to as new status. Even with the warranty, sending the phone back on the battery issue will be difficult as there is no good way that I can tell for the number to be ported over while I send the phone in for a battery replacement under warranty. That will take days that I can not afford to be without the phone.",Negatif
"The phone itself is great, overall.. Except that it has had problems of freezing up randomly here and there. When it happens, I cannot turn off the screen and have to wait for it to shut off on its own. I reported this problem to the seller, ChubbiesTech, and they gave me instructions on how to restart the phone when it freezes. This did not solve the problem, so I agreed to return it. The freezing would happen intermittently on a daily basis, usually multiple times in a day. I've put off returning it because it does have a 90 day warranty, and it is inconvenient not to have a phone for several days when making the exchange. So I still have the phone, and the freezing has been less of an issue lately. I am hoping that it resolves and doesn't return. However, I should never have had this issue in the first place!",Negatif
I bought my son this phone because he deserved an upgrade. His grades have been going up and I’m proud. Chubbiestech was great and sent a real top quality product. The phone was given to my son as a Christmas gift but since then there have been no problems with the device. It practically looks and feels like new!,Positif
"I was so nervous about ordering a refurbished phone, but needed to replace my iPhone 6s and needed an affordable option. So glad I took the chance, as so far has worked out great! Phone came packaged nicely in box (not original iPhone box) and included charger. Note that it did not include the headphones which was not an issue for me, not sure I would want refurbished headphones anyways. Phone was very clean and looked brand new. Set up was super easy as expected (no manual, but again not needed) and has been working perfectly. I am so thankful there is a trustworthy company offering an affordable option for this phone, and would buy from them again.",Positif
"So far so good! It’s only been a few days, but the experience so far has been perfect. The phone is in excellent condition, it looks brand new. Shipping took only about 2-3 days. I do think people should try and read the experiences that people had with that particular seller. I think it changes depending on the seller. Mine was with “MyWit”. The price was great as well. Overall happy with my experience!",Positif
Beautiful phone at first glance only to find out that the microphone does not work. So I brought the phone to local Apple store to find out what is wrong with the phone. Diagnostic showed that front left and right bottom microphone failed.,Negatif
"Phone was in excellent condition. I ordered the iPhone 6s 63gb silver. No scratche or dings. Came with charger but no earphones, which is ok. The only reason I’m giving this product 3 stars is that the phone was from Japan, which means that the camera shutter will not be silenced no matter what because Japanese law requires the cameras of their phones to always make a noice(for privacy reasons so that no one spies on people). It was only a problem for me because I can see how annoying it can be especially when your trying to take a quick and silent picture inside of a library or classroom for educational purposes. Other than that the phone worked great!",Positif
"There is a password on the phone it came in a dirty scratched box, no head phones and a dirty bunched up charger. When you are paying this much for something you expect it to look clean in a nice box and with the original accessorizes and no password.",Negatif
"The product is near perfect. There's not a single scratch on the body, but there's a little shadowing in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. It doesn't really bother me though. The biggest surprise was that it came with an authentic Apple charger, not an off-brand one like I got from BREED. The phone was definitely unlocked as it took my sim card and I had no trouble with the auto-transfer from my old phone to this new (to me) one. I will likely buy 4 more of these next year for my kids from MyWit only. I'm very happy.",Positif
"bought this as a replacement for my son who's other 6s battery expanded and knocked the screen out. This phone came in good delivery time and good shape. It looks as new, we put his straight talk sim card in and he was busy loading apps last I seen. We have only had the phone for (?) two weeks now and nothing strange has happened so I don't expect it to have any problems. I would Highly recommend this product from this seller and would not hesitate to purchase from them again in the future.",Positif
"Came quickly and works great- like new. I would focus on the supplier when buying these phones. I picked ABC direct because it has 99% overall positive reviews. Some of them are closer to 70% positive (not great in my mind). If you look carefully, the supplier changes daily and depending on the color and storage space you select. Investigate that specific supplier before making your choice.",Positif
"One positive thing: I ordered it ""Next Day"" delivery and it arrived in 24 hours.

The phone is mostly fine, but it does not hold a battery charge. My phone is one of my main work tools so I must make sure the phone is always at 100%. Otherwise, despite being plugged in, the phone will continue depleting. This happens sporadically, not everyday. But when it happens it's unnerving!

Another annoying thing is that it is not possible to silence the camera shutter sound effect when taking a picture. This is why I give it 1 star. I very often use the phone to take pictures of my dog or of street art and this loud noise distracts my dog and attracts attention from all within earshot. I researched it and apparently there are some countries that demand the phone be modified to function in this way. How creepy is that?!!! I guess that's what you get when buying a ""refurbished"" phone.",Negatif
"Purchased for my mother in law! It works well for her and has a decent battery. Not much to say as it is an iPhone (the Toyota Camry of the phone world)!

If it had any scratches, we could not find them. The screen looked new and it had everything that a new phone comes with.",Positif
"I was very scared to order a refurbished phone, but was very presently surprised with my order. The phone came well packaged in a white box with an Apple charging cable and power brick. That was a good surprise as the description for the phone said the accessories may not be Apple. The phone has no scratches or signs of wear whatsoever, and powered up easily. Set up with my new carrier was fast and easy, with no problems at all. The only thing I noticed is the battery doesn't seem to be perfect, but it's still really good and it is refurbished so that's to be expected. Other than that, it's exactly like new and I would highly reccomend.",Positif
Had this phone for about a week and completely satisfied. Phone was in excellent condition. I was concerned with the battery however it has performed well. Even if I have to replace the battery within the next few months I still think this is a great value. I read some of the negative reviews however I believe if you buy a refurbished phone expectations have to be lowered. That being said I am so impressed with this phone that I probably will never shop at an Apple store again. Many times you get what you pay for but this has not been my experience with this company.,Positif
"This came with the old battery. It has a battery max capacity of 80% which means the phone dies much faster than a phone with a new battery. I didn’t realize this until i noticed my phone was dying after about 8 hours after full charge overnight. By this time, i had this new phone set and didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending back and starting over. I think this seller counts on that. Now I have to set phone to low battery mode for it to last a day until I have the time to buy a new battery",Negatif
"This is a review for an iPhone 6s purchased from eKings.
After having to replace my child's phone for the third time I was not willing to pay Apple's price so despide a lot of negative reviews I decided to bite the bullet. I am very happy with the purchase. The iPhone arrived in pristine condition, packaged as if brand new! Everything works great, activated immediately with T-Mobile. The package included the small paper clip-like thing to remove the SIM card from my old phone. Overall great experience with this purchase from eKings. Note that the iPhone probably was not a US model since the shutter sound cannot be turned off.",Positif
"When the phone arrived, the speaker didn't work well. It has been very quiet and I can't even hear my gps when I drive. I called the warranty company which said I have 90 days warranty and they told me there is nothing they can do but trying to return it to Amazon. I can't listen to music on it, I can't call people on speaker, I can't use it for gps so I don't even know why I got this phone. Now I feel I am stuck with it with no further help. I will not recommend this product and the seller.",Negatif
"Phone meets if not exceeds my expectations of quality for a refurb phone. I had no trouble setting up after popping in my sim card. The battery seems okay. The only damage I noticed was very moderate and shallow scratching on the screen. I didn't even see it until the phone was powered off; it has no effect on the quality of the user experience whatsoever. Charger that came with it was aftermarket and there were no headphones - just as advertised and expected. Charger works just fine. I will be sure to update if I encounter any issues regarding the function. Thanks for the fast shipping! My phone came from Tech Venture, for reference.",Positif
"Basically, I receive it, charge it and start using it.
After I have done the setup, I started noticing the touchscreen doesn't work.
When typing, it doesn't take what I type in or response multiple times. For example, I tried to type ""run"". Sometimes, it only shows ""un"" or ""rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrun"". After contacting tech support, wipe out the phone and do everything again. After done setting, I don't even have any way to log in because one of my pin numbers has the problem. Tried to type ""0"", but the same situation happened. So, I decided to return it. When trying to wipe out the phone again, the same thing happened to final confirm wipe out area. Receiving this phone is really frustrating, the seller should check phone thoughtfully before sent out. If they don't, this is just wasting both sides' time and time is money. Giving one star because sending me something that doesn't work.",Negatif
I bought the phone and the battery started to not charge as well. We were just over 90 days so I couldn't return it. I took the phone to a local shop and they said whoever sold this to you put a cheap battery in it. I had the battery replaced and it is now working great. Please do not put bad batteries in the phones prior to selling just to save money.,Negatif
"Phone itself is excellent, but it came from Japan originally, so can NOT turn off annoying camera noise every time I take a picture. This makes it almost impossible to use for snapchat in a public place or even at home without annoying everyone. I am upset, that this was not mentioned. As a US citizen, I would never have purchased this particular phone if I had known about this fact. I am disappointed this is not in the product description very prominently.

Because of this experience, I will never buy a phone online from Amazon again.

GIVE THE CONSUMER THE INFORMATION!!!!!",Negatif
"Bought this phone for my son who is 11 and thought it will be a good option to get refurbished rather than a new one , given his age . However, this phone’s battery is completely useless ! Noticed battery percentage was going down really fast , then decide it to charge it to 100% and even set it to power saving mode . After a few hours , it went down to 30% without even using it ??
So disappointed with this purchase !! Will never buy from this seller again , would rather stick to Groupon since I bought 2 phones from them and never had any issues like this or any at all !",Negatif
"I got this phone in GOLD with 128GB back in February. I bought from the seller: CHUBBIESTECH. The phone was in WONDERFUL condition and came with a glass screen protector already installed. The package included the phone, a generic lightning port charger and block (neither of which actually worked to charge the phone, this didn't bother me, I already had a reliable charger that did work to charge the new phone), a sim card remover, and a plastic cellophane covering over the screen. Headphones were not included. Overall, the phone functioned perfectly with Cricket as my carrier. I did have to go to my carriers store to activate it and pick up a new sim card. The phone takes any NANO SIZED sim card. Over six months I found that the phone only had three flaws, all of which I considered minor:
1. The camera SHUTTER SOUND could not be turned off and was always on full volume.
2. The phone did not VIBRATE. I could never get it to vibrate, not from phone calls, notifications, custom patterns, or the like.
3. I would never receive NOTIFICATIONS from the Instagram app. notifications would appear in the corner of the widget on the homepage and when I open the app but never while out of the app or while my phone asleep.
I was definitely happy with purchase as a whole.",Positif
"Now it has another issue... This phone is amazing EXCEPT now that the battery has been replaced, which I had to fight to get done, there is a problem with the speaker. I can only use it when I am connected to a bluetooth speaker. Unless I am using headphones or a speaker, I can not use it as a phone AT ALL. No one can hear me. The iFix place said that I have to send it away to CA for them to attempt to fix it, and that is probably going to take weeks. I need a phone. This is silly. Waste of money, I will have to get a new phone because this is not worth it.

This iPhone was ok for being refurbished. The battery was at 82% capacity within a week. I got the battery replaced and after much back and forth I got it replaced locally. It's only a month old... And thankfully back to 100% so i don't have to charge it three times a day. I love having an iPhone, and I have been a very loyal Google phone owner since the beginning. Great camera.",Negatif
"Just received it. It looks fantastic. The outside has no visible marks or anything. The screen is awesome, and 3d touch works fine. The battery life seems like it's on par with a brand new iphone. It's unlocked, and the camera is just so awesome. Everything works fine. It even shipped with a 90 day warranty card. The box includes the phone, lightning connector and the adapter, which works okay. Great job, MyWit.",Positif
"Very nice packaging I was surprised but how neat it was. Looks like a brand new phone can’t detected any scars or scuffs. Came with charger but no headphone. But it’s alright the phone itself is perfect condition. The battery gets warm around 15 minutes of use but it’s ok. HIGHLY recommend buying it from ChubbiesTech!, What a great product.",Positif
"The phone arrived on time and was well packaged so there was no damage. I needed to run the IOS update, but that went smoothly once connected to the WiFi. I bought a case with this phone, so the ROSE color doesn't show anyhow. Don't get hung up on the color of the phone back side if you're just going to put it in a protective case. I've only noted an occasionally louder than usual home button press, but all else works just fine. I'm glad I got this refurbished 6s instead of the insanely high cost of a new phone. This particular phone works well. Will the one you bought work the same? I guess that's the same question for each purchase isn't it?",Positif
"Phone arrived in a timely manner and in great looking condition. Setting it up was easy since it was fully unlocked.
Only issues are that it does not hold a charge so I am constantly connecting to power, the charger it came with does not work with phone or any other Apple product and lastly the phone will randomly freeze up and will not respond to input.
I understand you take a risk with buying used so I have only me to be disappointed in.",Positif
"I didn't expect this phone to be perfect since it is refurbished. At first it was fine and I ignored the little things. But now I'm fed up. The ringer/vibrator doesn't work, the volume buttons work when they feel like it, fingerprint ID doesn't work, live photos take forever to load or sometimes don't work at all, there's always an error message when trying to open up photos, the screen freezes ALL THE TIME, and the phone shuts off randomly throughout the day. Also yesterday someone just happened to hack into my apple ID and purchased hundreds of dollars worth of apps on an iphone I do not recognize and never authorized. This phone has been giving me nothing but trouble and I'm done ignoring all these problems. Better off buying a brand new iphone.",Negatif
"This iPhone 6s is a good size, nice looking, is a reliable alarm clock, texting is easy, however, I cannot make or receive a phone call. I always get ""I cannot hear you, you are fading in and out""..... It has been this way since I got the phone. Would not buy a certified refurbished phone again.",Negatif
"Everything on the phone worked good, except for the speaker at the top used when making phone calls was way too quiet, making phone calls impossible unless it's on speaker. I'm gonna return it and hopefully the next one will work better",Negatif
"I don't like buying an item with more than 10% one star reviews, but I decided to gamble on this one. It turned out extremely well. The supplier quickly responded with the information I needed to be sure it would work with the service we chose and the phone arrived in mint condition. A new phone could not have been more pristine. One concern was the battery condition but it holds a charge almost as long as my flip phone.",Positif
I was nervous based upon at the reviews that the phone wouldn't work with the Sim but I went ahead and took a chance and I am very pleased with the phone it works fine and looks great the shipping didn't come the same day as guaranteed but it did come the next day so I will knock it off or that,Positif
I purchased this iPhone 2 months ago on 10/04/18. The phone worked fine at the beginning but 3 days later the battery started messing up that i had to take it to get the battery replaced. Now 2 months later my iPhone died completely. I placed my phone on the counter the night before. The next day when i wanted to use it the phone was completely dead. I thought the battery had died so i charged it during the day for hours waiting for it to turn on. It never did so i took it to get it fixed once again. At the place they told me it was the RAM of the phone that didn't work at all. I don't know how this happened because i took good care of the phone. That is why i give it a 2 over all rating.,Negatif
It came looking brand new and works great. Since it’s a refurbished iPhone the battery might be a little aged but It’s an easy fix especially with Apple replacing it at 30 dollars for the rest of 2018. If your looking for a good phone then this is the place. I’ve noticed that there are different sellers for each color and space grey seems to get the bad reviews. FYI.,Positif
"After having my phone stolen I needed a new one and did not want to have to open a new carrier contract. I purchased this iPhone from Prime Mobility at a good price. I got a new SIM card from T-Mobile and put it in the phone as soon as it arrived, which happened to be next day in this case. No issues at all. Phone looks and performs like its brand new.",Positif
"Bought it to replace a 5c with 8 GB. I’ve only had it a month. So far all is good. Installed the ATT SIM card from the 5c, no problems. In settings, under “battery health” it says %100. The iPhone 6 is the last iPhone with a headphone jack. Bad decision by Apple. My next phone will probably not be from them. Really enjoying the extra storage. Since it’s unlocke,it is also a good travel phone, when going to Europe, just buy a local temporary sim card. Pop it in and avoid huge roaming charges",Positif

"We purchased 2 identical iPhone 6S phones. The glass was immaculate and everything functioned just right. The only problem was sometimes, a few parties I called on one of them said my voice was muffled and couldn't hear me well. I called Kanga and it was an easy fix - just hard reset the phone. They were very eager to know we were satisfied. And we are. Ask me in a year...",Positif
"Ordered iPhone 6s about 6 months ago. The phone has been great, considering the decent price and how fast the product was shipped and received. The only down side is the life of the battery is horrible. It will say it has 12% charge and automatically shut off due to dying battery. And when its supposedly fully charged , it seems like in no time is dying saying 20% , then 10%. Sometimes it can make you want to cry, if something special is going on and you are wanting to capture the moment , pull out your phone knowing you have enough charge to do what you need to, and only for your phone to beep and say its dead. Pain in the butt sometimes .. Other then that the phone has been completely wonderful I couldn't be any more happier with it then I am. I am looking into replacing the battery tho .",Positif
"Love the iPhone products but was hoping to save some money on my daughter's phone. Within 90 days the microphone stopped working. Well it still worked, it was just impossible to have conversation on the iPhone. I contacted the seller who could not locate my customer record. I then contacted amazon for help and they graciously offered to waive the 30 day return window and let me return the phone. This seemed like a reasonable solution, until I discovered the 20% restocking fee!! Almost $70 hit on a 2 month old ""refurbished warranty"". If I would have known I was going to be charged that much, I would have sent it in for repairs as per their product warranty. I guess I will be buying my phones new from now on.",Negatif
"The battery on this phone does not work. I fully charged the phone and put it on airplane mode. By the time I woke up the battery was at 1%. I’d give it negative stars if I could. Even if I’m not using the phone at all and it’s in my pocket, the battery drains itself l. I’ve had to charge the phone several times a day to have a few ten minute phone conversations because on a full charge it will die after a five minute phone conversation. Wish I could unbuy this phone.",Negatif
The phone didn't work properly... As per costumer service that device should not have passed the quality inspection process.,Negatif
"The price was so great, I really wanted this phone purchase to work out. I went ahead and made sure the rating for the seller, Tech Venture, was high as others suggested before purchasing. Got my refurbished iPhone and a few days after setting it up, I noticed the battery died rather quickly. Because the screen was replaced by a ‘third party’, Apple wouldn’t install the battery. The screen also started flashing black and often I couldn’t not answer calls. If I could get it to answer, frerquently I could not end the call, access anything on the screen or even turn the phone off. I messaged Tech Venture about it- their solution was to pay $300 and order another phone from them which would be refunded when they recieved and processed the first phone OR send the phone back and wait for a new one to arrive. I went with the first option as I use my phone for work as well as personal and would have a tough time being without it for a week+. The second phone came quickly (thank you Amazaon shipping). Upon opening, I noticed the phone was a bit dirty and had a few more dents on it than the first. When setting it up, the phone became hot to the touch before I could complete the set up process. I didn’t proceed any further but sent them both back. So after two phone returns and a month or so, I finally have all my money refunded and a phone ordered directly from Apple in hand. A positive that I will note is that Tech Venture was quick to respond to my emails.",Negatif
"I was pleasantly surprised when the 6S iphone arrived earlier than expected. It came in a new box similar to that of a new phone. I was impressed with a brand new charger adapter and cord neatly wrapped in the box. The rose colored phone looked virtually new with a protective film of both sides of the phone. As ordered, the phone was a an unlocked GSM that fired right up after inserting my old TMobile sim card (the old phone went for a dip in our pool.) All of the old data, contacts, e-mails magically downloaded from the I-Cloud. I have only had the phone for three days so I cannot comment on its long term reliability but I have no reason to question it. I selected Amazon Dealfisher because it was sponsored by Amazon and had very high long term ratings.",Positif
The iPhone wasn't unlocked. I had to returned it to the seller.,Negatif
"The phone was great for the first couple of weeks, but then started acting up. The camera first started to lock up then the phone itself started to get hot. I tried contacting the seller thru email and even tried to call but never got a response. Of course now the phone is past its 30 day warranty.",Negatif
"Ordered the phone and it arrived on time and packaged nicely. No real signs of wear, and phone booted fine. The problem ensued about two days after getting the phone. It would no longer hold a full charge and began shutting off at around 18% to 24%, depending on if it was in power saver or not, a clear sign that the battery was defective. For a refurbished phone that is supposed to ""work like new,"" that is unacceptable. My son has an iPhone SE that he has had for a year and a half that has better battery life and battery wear than this phone. Thankfully, we were able to get a refund, but I would not buy from this seller again. Now I am down a phone and not sure if I am willing to trust any ""certified refurbished"" phone again.",Negatif
"Physically the phone was in great shape. It looked brand new, ready for setup. Further inspection showed issues. Battery drained super quickly and the camera wouldn’t focus. Took it in to the Apple Store (I HIGHLY recommend doing that) to run a diagnostic. They found the battery was failing and needed to be replaced and found the camera had issues too. Apple resolved it, thankfully, but I was disappointed that these issues weren’t assessed and handled prior to shipment. While I know the phones aren’t brand new, I expected a “certified refurbished” phone to at least have a camera that worked.",Negatif
"Bought this for my daughter and we are very happy with the purchase! Cosmetically, the phone is in brand new, 10/10 condition! Works just like a brand new phone. Cord & block are aftermarket & work great, but we already had Apple branded cord and block so she is using those. Set up was simple. For Straight Talk I just switched the sim from her 5s to the 6s. Will update on battery life after some use, but so far it is working perfectly and my daughter couldn't be happier! (My pictures aren't the best quality, so anything that may look imperfect is definitely from my camera and not on the phone itself!)
ETA: We're a couple months in & this phone has held up famously. Battery life is perfect, no quirks, no glitches, no loosey goosey ports, nothing wrong at all. Still an A+++",Positif

"i like this phone a lot. i recommend checking the battery life, if it’s starts to get below 80 it’ll kinda die fast, but you can go to atat and get a battery replacement for only $30 till the end of 2018. i had problems with hearing when people called when i first got my iphone, all you need to do is get a q-tip, put some rubbing alcohol on it and rub the front speaker by the front camera, it’s a line. keep having somebody call you and talk to see if you can hear better, repeat rubbing the q tip if it’s still quiet. hope this helps!",Positif
"Just got the phone. Charged it with the provided charger. Transferred everything from iPhone 5s and phone was hot. The battery health says that it's only 82% maximum capacity even when fully charged. Not sure who refurbished this. Hoping they will resolve this and I can change the rating. It's supposed to be ""A Certified Refurbished product has been tested and certified to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear."" It's not working like new...but it does look clean on the outside so I give them that. But I'd rather it have a little blemish on the outside and like new on the inside.",Negatif
"My Phone Came In Great Condition From “Chubbiestech” even though it Said refurbished the phone looked perfectly new I was expecting a small scratch or dent but there was nothing.

"So I’ve bought iPhones on amazon before, and each time I’ve received a bad phone. I bought this with the hope that it would be better and it is, BUT I will say that the battery does not last as long as it should, that being said I think this is the better of others and I’m (honestly) too worried to have them switch it out. I’ve been using this one for a week and noticed the battery was an issue, but I don’t mind it too much. As other reviews say theirs are Japanese products and the camera sound does not turn off, this one does NOT have that issue and everything works just fine. Occasionally an app will crash, but that may just be the app. Happy purchase.",Positif
the touch screen would get defective sometimes. battery life seemed shorter than normal and the charger was poor quality. did not come with headphones.,Positif
The unlocked phone looked brand new with no scratches to be found and operates flawlessly on T-Mobile. Using the iPhone's new Battery Health (Beta) feature it says the maximum capacity is 86%. If the battery health was in the 90% I would've given it 5 stars. Very pleased and would buy again without hesitation!,Positif
I purchased this IPhone 6S - 64GB - Space Grey Colour (Certified Refurbished) in October' 2016 and started using it. However now only after 7 Months the same has stopped working. I am not able to switch it on at all. I am in India and Apple Service Center is not repairing the same saying that it is out of Warranty. I have paid so much money and the same has gone waste. Apple Service Center in India has checked the history of this purchased IPhone through its IMEI Number and says that this phone has earlier also faced the same problem and now again the phone is dead. I have no idea what to do. I do not recommend anyone to buy Certified Refurbished IPhones.,Negatif
"I received this phone and at first I was very happy but then with in a week the camera started playing up and I was on a road trip that I was needing a camera for. The camera would not focus when taking close up photos and sometime it would shake in the screen, was very odd. I am in the middle of returning it and getting a refund from amazon.",Positif
"This phone is dope y’all. I ordered this reluctantly and let me tell you why. The last refurbished phone I had was all banged up when it got delivered, it was so glitchy and slow, and it didn’t meet ANY of my expectations.

However, this phone? It’s awesome. It came in great condition. The color is just what I wanted. The speed is good, comparable to a store-bought iPhone. Basically you’re getting your money’s worth! It’s a safe buy.

The phone even came with a starter case, a charger, and a wall plug in.

I’ve had one or two instances where the phone automatically reboots. The app your using will close and the screen will black out. It immediately comes back on within 5 seconds or so but it’s a little sketchy! That’s the only issue that I’ve noticed and I’m still recommending this phone because I’m otherwise very satisfied.",Positif
"This 6S arrived in two days as advertised. It was in new condition with the exception of two tiny marks on the back and a very small scuff on one corner. The glass was perfect. This phone is a replacement for my 5S, which I had backed up on my Macbook. The Macbook and 6S refused to talk to one another and I finally had to call T-Mobil. Working with their tech, I finally was able to convince the computer and phone to communicate. It turns out the phone was woefully behind in software updates. It must have been sitting on a shelf for an extended period. Once we got the downloads going it took over 20 minutes to complete. Ultimately, I spend almost an hour working with T-Mobil, but the tech was great.
IMPORTANT: I was careful to buy the phone from DealFisher, which is the highest rated vendor I could identify.",Positif
I had this product for approximately two weeks before the screen started flashing before turning black. It would take anywhere from five minutes to an hour before it would resume functioning. This problem worsened over time until eventually it would no longer turn on. When I tried to contact the company for assistance they would not respond.,Negatif
"The phone arrived and seemed to work well, but almost as soon as the warranty expired, the charging ability expired as well. The Apple store will not repair a refurbished phone, the warranty was good for only 3 months, so we are left with a useless brick. I have bought refurbished Samsung phones before and have never had an issue. This iPhone was junk and I will not buy one again.",Negatif
"I received my phone yesterday and had an issue with installing a metro pcs Sim card. I contacted the sellers through email and 20 mins later they responded. It was an error on my end not contacting metro to swap phones. I am very pleased with my phone , thanks guys.",Positif
"My biggest issue? Once the phone reaches 20% battery life, it dies...very troublesome and inconvenient.

Other than that, I had no issues setting it up and swapping in my old SIM card and everything is working as it should in terms of overall usability.",Positif
I love this phone in perfect working condition.,Positif
The iPhone died after the 90 day window and the only response was 'too bad'. If you can't certify that the product will function you shouldn't sell it as certified refurbished.,Negatif
"Phone came looking good as new. Not a scratch on it. Runs great and works almost good as new. It's super fast, has tons of storage, and gets the job done. Only problems I can report are the vibrate is kinda funky; it's slower and clunkier, doesn't have that crisp buzz you get from new phones. It also opens apple pay when not wanted every now and then, and the battery life could be better, but that's something that would be an issue with a brand new phone as well. 3d touch is also spotty, find it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't when trying to use it to switch apps. Not sure if that's due to the refurbished factor or if similar problems with it happen with new devices, or if it's because of my screen protector, but still work noting.
Overall a great value and I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",Positif

I am looking forward to seeing how it works with the SIM and hoping for the best. Everything else about the phone is in prime condition.

"The phone was shutting off quite often so I took it to Apple store to help me realize what was going on and the Genius Bar attendant said this wasn't an Apple phone, even though my Apple ID runs on it and I can purchase apps and everything on iTunes. Bottom line is phone continues not working properly, weird noises and muffled sounds when talking, battery is a mess, sometimes it lasts about 20min only after being 100% charged, and indeed camera quality is awful when I was exposed at Apple Store how a real iPhone would take pictures.",Negatif
"Phone arrived in great physical condition, no scratches really, and I had no problem setting it up etc. However after using it for a few weeks, I learned the many bugs that I didn’t catch right away. Such as Bluetooth completely doesn’t work, I can’t get the camera click to silent, the ringer doesn’t always ring, among other annoying things. It works, but it was definitely not totally refurbished. Not worth the price. I’m not quite sure what refurbished even means to this seller. No Bluetooth is a big bummer and I feel the seller should have listed that it didn’t work and discounted at the very least. Buying online sight unseen is risk! Something probably doesn’t work or is faulty and you won’t find out until you need it.",Negatif

I was able to call my daughter for about a week from my Droid. Then I could not get through, but she was still able to communicate with some of her contacts. Took me a few months of phone calls and running around to different Verizon stores to find out it's not unlocked. Most of my daughters contacts have iPhone, and since iPhone can communicate with each other, she was able to talk to some people. Took me a while to figure out that those talking to her all had iPhones. It has been too long to return this phone, so I'm probably loss all that money, and still have to buy her a phone. This is a scam! Don't waste your money!!!",Negatif

Phone was in perfect working order. It was unlocked as stated and there were no flaws in anything. The phone even had the new plastic film to protect the screen and the back from scratches. Have been using the phone for several months now with no issues. Love it and would do business with these people again!,Positif
I am HAPPY AS HELL with my purchase phone looks brand new ! And it was unlocked for metro pcs ! Thank you so much ! No complaints here,Positif
"Phone looks in good condition, no cracks no nothing and 3D Touch and fingerprint works perfectly fine with everything else. Came in a brown box with a charger cube and the chord itself. The Phone may need a SIM card to activate it because it happened to me, so to anyone that just want to use it like a iPod there may be a chance where you need to put a SIM card in it to activate it ( ask anyone, friend or family if you may borrow it real quick ) once it's activated , you can take out the SIM card and use it how ever you want to. Overall it's In perfect condition, i recommend this buyer.",Positif
"I can't find any scratches, dents/dings or anything like that. It looks brand new and functions the same. Set up was incredibly easy. I literally just swapped out sim cards, when through the standard ""new phone"" on-screen Apple instructions, and before I knew it the phone was ready to go. Couldn't be happier with it.",Positif
"As I begin to write this review, I notice the battery life diminishing, dropping each percentage like seconds ticking by. I’ve had this phone for one year and one month, plus a couple of days, and it has been infuriating the entire time. Touch screen malfunctioning in corners, ghost writing appearing on my text screen, random shut downs when outside temperatures drop below 30 degrees (I live in Vermont), multiple phone chargers fried, phone calls dropping and/or put through to FaceTime....... it’s been a year of this, so I can’t remember it all. One thing after the other. I have purchased two replacement screens and a new battery, which are very expensive. Whether this be apples ploy to keep their profits high from services, or this tech company’s negligence, don’t count on these technologies to be a long term investment.",Negatif
"Some of the reviews were scary so I purchased this with some trepidation. Unwarranted. My purchase arrived on time, looks new, was unlocked, no glitches and the battery life is great. Just wished it came with a $50 iTunes phone card. In other words, I have no sensible complaints.",Positif
This phone came as new! Mywit is a good seller! It came with a new adapter and charger cord. It’s legit. The only thing I didn’t like was that I paid for two day shipping and it didnt come til 4 days later but that wasn’t amazon’s or the seller’s fault. FedEx is the worst delivery company. I will never use them again. Overall the phone is awesome. No scratches. No dents. Everything works. And I had no problem with my sims card. I’m so in love with the color (Rose Gold),Positif
"I bought 2
iphones with 64 GB. I got one with so many scratches on the screen surface and I returned it. I thought 2nd one is fine. After I used the other one for 20 days I realized it's actually 16 GB. Few days ago i travelleld to India and I can't return it now.
I got cheated overall.vwry bad expy",Negatif
I have had this phone for about a month and it has been working great. It looks brand new. No scratches or cracks. Battery doesn't last as long as it would if it were brand new but still lasts pretty long. Usually charge it once a day or twice if I'm constantly on it. The price is great and more affordable than buying it brand new. It worked fine with my T-Mobile service.,Positif
"I was quite impressed with how well this item looks, especially since it is a certified refurbished item, it looks like it is brand new. I had no problems setting it up and getting my service (AT&T) switched over to it. The charger that came with it is ok, even though I am using a different one that I already had. I did have to buy my own ear buds, it would have been nice if they had come with it also. Be prepared to spend a little money on accessories, you will want, especially if this is your first iPhone. All in all, a great item. 8)",Positif
It looks so good just perfect can't beat the price for a fully unlocked phone,Positif
"The phone was left on, so the battery drained itself completely. Draining the battery like that is really bad for lithium batteries, so thanks for nothing. Also, it is supposed to be ""like new"", but I didn't know that new phones came with hundreds of tiny scratches on the screen. I guess Apple can't afford Gorilla Glass (like my $80 Android Motorola phone has)?",Positif
"This phone appeared to work fine for the first week but then needed to be charged more and more frequently. Within 2 weeks of buying it it would go from 100% battery to dead within 15 minutes.

Settings told me that my battery was significantly degraded. On a *refurbished* phone which should have gotten a new battery as a matter of course.

I messaged the seller and received no reply. Be wary.

ETA: I changed the review from a 2-star to a 1-star review. When I opened the phone to replace the battery, the covers inside the phone were missing and there was literally scotch tape holding the connectors in place. TAPE.",Negatif
"I ordered this iPhone 6S after a good amount of researching online as to what my needs were and where I would get the best deals. Amazon's price was the most competitive for the product value. The phone came in great packaging, it looked like it was new. Starting up and setting up the phone was as easy as one would expect an Apple product to be and since I previously had an iPhone 5C (also purchased on Amazon.com), transferring all my information to the new phone was very easy.

As of now, the phone works and looks like a new product. Battery life is good. All features and functions on the product seem to be working as expected.",Positif
"Product description reads ""certified to work and look like new"". They are no where near like new. Mine came with a broken camera and the phone looks like it's 50 years old. The quality on Amazon is getting worse by the day. Instead of wasting his time with his blog WaPo, Jeff Bezos should focus more on his business and make sure Amazon stops degrading so rapidly.",Negatif
"The phone arrived in an attractive MyWit box with warranty card. Condition of device was very good - screen is mint without scratches, battery is at 96% capacity, and back has one scratch and minor scratching around charging port. All in all a great deal and I would buy a refurbished iPhone from MyWit again any day. Be careful which seller you choose!",Positif
"The device is in perfect condition astetically, and it functions as it should; however, the battery life is significantly diminished as indicated by the device's battery application (in the settings). Be that as it may, I love the device, and if it were not for the battery quality being so used I would have rated 5 stars. There is no other indication that this device was previously owned.",Positif
"Very unhappy.
Phone came stuffed in a USPS envelope. The phone has these three dots (see pic) that are always there when the screen is on. The charger is really flimsy. I would not use it unattended just because I feel like it may get too hot and start sparking.
I would look at other vendors or apple certified products before buying from this vendor.",Negatif
Exactly what I hoped for- my I phone 6 was stolen and this replace the was at a lower price than AT&T would've given me ! Phone arrived quickly and wais perfect,Positif
"Ive has the phone for a couple moths now and everything is still completely fine. The only problem i have with it l is that i believe it was manufactured in japan or in another country where its illegal to have your camera silenced because i'm unable to silence it without jail breaking it (and i'm far too lazy to do that). However it's not too terrible to deal with, the actual camera itself just makes a beep noise, snapchat makes the full on shutter sound though. I just cover up the speaker when i take a picture and that almost completely silences it.",Positif
I was a little concerned that this phone would be a dud but it's been great! It came with a couple small scratches on the screen and a sun spot on the back where the logo is (indicating a previous otter box case) but other than that the physical part was great. The only concern about the actual phone is the battery life. I can't be sure but I feel like it's shorter than it should be. Other than that it's been a really great phone and Id highly recommend it to anyone who wants to save money but still get Apple products!,Positif
"Came in perfect condition. No scratches or marks at all on the body. Functions great. Swapped T-Mobile SIM from 5c and logged into network without a hitch. Only way it could have been better is if it shipped with the little ""key"" used to pop out the SIM carrier. The ""keyhole"" diameter is smaller than a pushpin (tack) or a paperclip, so it could be difficult to find something laying around the house to pop it open.",Positif
"I was worried looking at a lot of the bad reviews to see if my phone would come out bad. So I took my chances and bought from the seller Chubbistech and I was very impressed by what had come, the quality of the phone was perfect with no scratches on the screen or anything. The phone was unlocked and worked with my sim. Over all a great phone.
I want specifically mention the seller Chubbiestech from whom I ordered the phone. A very ethical and professional company with great customer care service. The person from their company Karen was very prompt in replying to my queries and was very helpful. O would definitely recommend to buy from this seller. A+",Positif
"I have waited 4 months so I could give a quality interview on this. Refurbished means that this phone once upon a time was used, so something was bound to be wrong. This phone overall performs really well and was a lot faster than my phone before this. The camera on this is quite astounding for how old it is compared to the newer phones. The only problem with this phone is the ringer button by the sound buttons. I have to fidget with it to keep it so the phone will stay silent and not turn off. Sometimes it can be a pain, but the phone in of itself is great and I would totally recommend from these guys. It came in a day early and was easy to setup.",Positif
"phone was great. as advertised, but only lasted less than 4 months. had a 90 day warranty, which I get. asked supplier if they would do a discount to buy another under the circumstances and they said NO.",Negatif
"Now I’m forced to change my feedback as this mobile is not working. This worked for 45 days and now it has 2 issues:
1. Charging goes down from 80-90% to 10% or 0% sometimes.
2. I’m using same network in my both mobiles but this mobile appears as ‘no service’. To get the network, either restart or wait for it to appear.

Now I’ve to bare restocking fee and return shipping charges as return window period is over. Will not buy anymore used products.",Negatif
"Pros
Phone is in a good working condition.
No Scrach.on the body.
Timely delivery by amazon

Cons
non apple cable and Charger
No headfones

Overall - so far, looks good value for money.",Positif
"My iPhone was good for the first two months. After that it kept glitching a few times a day for no reason. It's still usable because it freezes for like fifteen second everytime. But these fifteen seconds could be frustrating if you were in hurry and it kept happening to you a lot.

I don't recommend this product.",Negatif
LOVE this phone. I was originally very very weary and hesitant to buy from a third party especially after reading some horrible reviews. But this phone has been an absolute gem for me. I have had no problems yet. (knock on wood). It arrived in great condition as described. I am overall very pleased with this,Positif
"I know... is an used phone. But a “phone” needs to sound to be used. With a failure as mine has, I only can talk with someone with speaker mode because otherwise is impossible. Then, return a phone is not so easy to do. So finally I paid for a phone that doesn’t work as basically has to do, because you can understand little scratches, but no sound in the ear speaker? Bad bad.",Negatif
"I liked how fast I received it and how it came in near perfect condition! The battery life came at 89% which is better than the last phone I got. Really pretty, really nice. Looks brand new and works as good as one as well. The customer service from MyWit was great. They helped me out with whatever I needed. Overall great experience!",Positif
"The phone after less than three months has quit working! The touch screen no longer works and the item is not even original! Took It to the Apple Store and they found it not original based on the serial number, it was space grey not rose gold! Now stuck with a $450 dollar paper weight! Don't buy from this company!",Negatif
"What can I say about an iPhone other than it works.

The phone was refurbished properly and I couldn't find any scratches or blemishes. The battery is decent and it looked new.",Positif
"The phone worked well in everything except when pairing it with a blutooth device. The audio seemed to be delayed. Initially i believed it was a software issue and would be fixed by updating it or playing with the settings, but after couple consultations with apple advisors it seemed that the issue was related to hardware, and fixing it was somewhere around 330+ $. Which is basically this phone's price. But other than the blutooth the phone is in good condition.",Positif
It was completely as advertised. No scratches or signs of wear. It works great and still $100+ below buying a new phone of the same age. I rated the battery life low just because it came at 85%. which is above the guaranteed minimum. It would be perfect if the batteries were replaced.,Positif
"So far so good. Had phone for about 10 days
- Delivered on time
- GSM Unlocked as advertised
- No visible blemishes. Phone in pristine order.
- Charger socket seems to be used but doesn't seem to be an aftermarket one. Lightning cable new, might be aftermarket.
- Battery in poor condition. Got the batter replaced at Apple Store at 30 dollars, approx.

Overall satisfied. I was expecting to have battery issues as the phone is an used one. Phone running like new.

Thumbsup to Seller Gryphon Commerce",Positif
"This arrived 2 days ahead of schedule, and it was so easy to set up. For me it was an upgrade from an iPhone 5 that had been dropped one too many times. While not much larger than the 5 the screen is so much sharper, function is faster, and so far I am delighted with this purchase.",Positif
Amazing! Didn't expect it to be in perfect condition but it did turn out to be perfect. It doesn't come in the official box but regardless of it its amazing!,Positif
"I received my 6s space gray two days earlier than expected. This gave me a good impression. It comes with brand new charger(not sure if it's Apple OEM). The phone shows almost no sign of wears and I don't see any scratch at all which is far beyond my expectations. I tested the battery life, camera quality, internet speed with wifi and LTE and system responsiveness. Everything meets the expected qualities of a 1 and half years old iPhone 6s. I guess the previous owner took a good care of it. It's a good deal!",Positif
"This is one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. Came in ABSOLUTE perfect condition. Looked 100% brand new. Also, the company added a 1 YEAR warranty. Just slipped in my SIM card and off we went. I bought this for my daughter(I'm an Android person) but will now see if this company sells those as well. She loves it and can't say enough about borde mixed this is!! Thank you!",Positif
very deep scratches!! not as good as it says! hate it! I bought a 5s from another seller and it came as new.,Negatif
I like the size and functionality of the 6s. Had one as my company device and bought this one when I retired. Great battery life for an Apple product!,Positif
This refurbished phone was a dud. Its buttons were stiff on the sides. Somethng inside was loose and would rattle around like a screw. After all of this it never powered again after the initial set up. Dont buy refurbished unlss from Apple.,Negatif
Works great and looks new.,Positif
As described. Flawless product. Smooth transaction.,Positif
"This is a great phone and it worked right out of the box, mostly. I plugged in my T-Mobile sim card and the phone worked immediately.

The only reason this product isn't getting 5 stars is that it shipped with the ear speaker clogged with gunk to the point that no sound came through until I cleaned it out myself. Also, the cable that it came with didn't work (which I didn't realize until I was camping in the middle of nowhere with a dead phone).",Positif
I paid $273.00 for a phone that doesnt work at all. The first day It came on and as soon as I programmed and set up everything up. It did some kind of update thing were it powered down and the screen went black and a circle (buffering ) did that for over 24 hours non stop. Also the sound was not clear while trying to use certain Apps. The seller never sent a return slip a few weeks later the phone just came on by itself. It worked for 1 day and never came back on... I had to go to a store and purchase another phone outright!,Negatif
Bought for wife. She has iPhone for work. The constant switch between IOS and Android was a source of frustration. So got 6s with OtterBox ang glass screen protector for less than 240. She loves it and is so glad I got early Christmas present for her. I could not see any sign of use.,Positif
Looked great and worked fine just ordered the 6s not the plus,Positif
"Within a few weeks of purchase I began to have cellular connectivity issues. I get no signal or low signal all the time, despite being right next to a cell tower. Assuming it was a SIM or software issue I thought the phone was ok. I did just get it after all. I’ve come to find out I’ve been sold a pile of junk that probably wasn’t properly diagnosed but just stamped as “refurbished” and sent out the door. The RF chip should have been replaced. Very disappointed with the seller.",Negatif
"First off: I’m the one that reads all the reviews, but have literally NEVER posted a review. This warranted one. The seller was Buyspry. The phone was absolutely FLAWLESS! Not a single scratch, dent, or mark. It’s was packaged beautifully and even had a screen protector already on it. I’m on day two of using the phone, everything works great and the battery life is what I typically had by the end of the day with my old iPhone. Hope this review helps anyone else who is like me in regards to reading all reviews prior to purchasing.",Positif
Our new phone skips all the time... I will be on a page and it will just close down for NO REASON!!! and the text works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work right ! Wish I would have bought a different one.,Positif
Working great. I got the H2O wireless sim card and installed it in the phone. Called customer service and gave them the code for it. They updated my account with the new sim card and everything was transmitted to my phone with out any glitches. I did not have the pics but I had them saved on my PC and plugged in the phone to get them.,Positif
"My phone came 4 days early which is great. This is an honest review guys so I am going to be very honest. I ordered from the seller OlympicWireless and also fulfilled by amazon. When I opened the box the phone looked amazing. The only thing was the home button wouldn’t press down. It still worked so that was no big deal. The battery health was at 86% which is not bad at all. Camera looks great and all the buttons work. I have not yet activated it because it is a gift for my sister as she is going from an android to an iPhone. As far as mechanics, it works great. I will be giving feedback as she uses the phone for a longer period of time",Positif
"I was very skeptical about buying a referbished phone but I decided to give it a try after looking at different phones from several orher providers. I got my phone on time, in almost perfect condition. It obviously had a little wear on the sides which is not a big deal to me because my camera and the speed of the phone is lovely. My only issue that I seem to have with this iphone is that the battery dies so quickly that it wont hold me til the end of the day if I charged it fully and left the house around 10-11. I did buy a case for this situation so that I can charge it on the go. I just wish I didnt have to. Might eventually replace the battery but its costly.",Positif
"Phone is exactly as described, in perfect cosmetic and functional condition. Saved some money and will wait and see what the iPhone 8 looks like next year.",Positif
Had trouble with this unit. When I would go to recent calls the screen would turn milky and I could not read the call. Too clear this I would have to go back to the home page and reboot the unit. After dealing with this issue so long I sent it back.,Negatif
Returned this item because it was not Apple refurbished.,Positif
"I got my iPhone 6s 128gb rose gold from the seller WBB LLC it came in excellent condition it was fully unlocked and it works great it was easy to set up and transfer all my stuff over from my iPhone 5s and I am glad I made the upgrade. I was hesistant at first to buy because of all the bad reviews, however in the end I am happy with my purchase and it came earlier than expected!",Positif
"I bought this phone in June 2017
Stop working after being reset by itself on August 2018
Still brand new, turn on and charging correctly, Sim card show up normally
The only issue, it doesn't give any access to any source of network (Wifi and Data) and it doesn't work via ITunes for the reactivation
Go everywhere with it, they say it might be a server problem. Only Apple can check it.
I don't have Apple store near me
So sad",Negatif
The seller I purchased from was Exclusive Electronics and I got the iPhone 6s 16gb in silver. Everything seems great. I placed my order around 10:30am and got one day shipping and it arrived by 5:30pm. The phone was in very good shape with a tiny scratch on the phone that I didn't even notice until I was applying a screen protector. It came with a long generic charger. This phone was purchased as a gift and I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend exclusive electronics. Despite the scratch I give 5 stars because with remanufactured items I expect them to not be perfect.,Positif
"Great product. Purchased from Magic Mobile. It comes with a non original charger and cable which work perfectly. The phone is in perfect conditions. Just like new, like the description said. The price is great with a huge discount from the new product. If you don't mind that it's not new, this is a great way to go.",Positif
The iPhone came intact perfectly operating footprint unlocked for all operators I brought to Ecuador from where I am originally and it works perfect the only thing that I see a bit is the battery is discharged quickly but soon I will buy an original from there in more works perfect aesthetically intact without any rayon buy the 64gb version in pink gold and so far it works well I came the charger and nothing else the box did not bring it because of migration in my country we have a few rare laws I recommend this seller,Positif
"Phone is fine. Clean, not scratched, packaged well. Problem, not updated to the current IOS, so when you try to sync it on iTunes from back up, doesn't work. ""Corrupt......."" Does not give you instructions on how to update the phone. Get past that, I would recommend.",Positif
My iphone came like new. The screen has zero scratch and works perfectly.,Positif
"Very good deal. Battery is now not as good (writing this review one year after purchase), but I have had this problem with every single apple gadget. Batteries tend to wear out and need charging more often. Other than that it works perfectly.",Positif
The phone was not able to keep connected to the carrier signal. It wasn't possible to use the phone unless I am as connected to wifi. I had to return the phone. One good thing the returning process was easy and efficient.,Negatif
"Literally was skeptical because I researched and found negative reviews about refurbished phones, but this phone came and not a scratch or dent was on it! Looked new felt new and the battery life is great!",Positif
"Excellent choice and transaction. I have exactly the same phone (but bought new) through my work; they paid more than twice as much. I can’t tell any difference, neither in terms of optical finish nor performance. It came very well packaged. I took it to the next AT&T store to get a new SIM card inserted. Also their representative was very impressed by the optical appearance and functionality of the IPhone 6s (and he makes a living by looking at and operating phones. This says it all).",Positif
"My screen began malfunctioning a couple months in - it did it intermittently so I thought perhaps it was my screen cover and didn't contact the seller. It turns out, it was not my screen cover, it's the phone. It's barely functional. To make matters worse, the ringer doesn't work. I wish I'd spent my money elsewhere. I have bought refurbished products from other sellers previously with no issues.",Negatif
Excellent purchase. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Looked like a new phone. Activated with no problem. Surprisingly pleased.,Positif
"Works like a charm! I looked all over, and I couldn't find any signs of wear (ie: scratches, cracks, etc.) and all the accessories worked great, too! It's important to note that this is a certified refurbished item, so if you do end up having an issue with the product after your purchase, Amazon will vouch for you.",Positif
"Excellent seller Chubbiestech. Phone looks like brand new. Not a single scratch. Battery life, like new. Unlocked, the phone worked immediately that a SIM card was inserted. Works in the Caribbean.",Positif

"2 months before i have given 5 ratings for this product and for the associated vendor. But the phone is not working after 2 months. First issue has started with camera followed by multi issues. Not sure how they tested this product. im planning to return this item.

I'm updating my prior review comments and providing rating here as 1. 2 months before, i got excited after seeing the scratch free and dent free iphone though it was refurbished and provided 5 star rating but now im feeling bad on that.",Negatif
The Bluetooth does not work and the battery drains quick. Wasted so much of my time.,Negatif
It's essentially a brand new phone. AT&T store set it up for me with only a $5 charge for a new SIM card.Works just like it's supposed to.,Positif
"I was a little skeptical after I saw all these reviews from, so many different sellers. But when I got a gold 64gb iPhone 6s from the seller MyWit, I actually was surprised to see it in a professional looking box, in perfect looking condition. There wasn’t even so much as a scratch or dent on the phone! I’ve had it for around 2-3 days now and see no problems at all so far. Would definitely recommend from this seller",Positif

 I love this phone. It’s very nice and high speed with apps along with all that good stuff. Battery life is 86% expectancy which is the same as my iPhone 7plus. It came with a new charger in perfect condition. The picture posted has smug marks due to me touching it and there’s very very slight smudge by the camera but dude this phone is so nice! I was expecting way worse to be honest. Audio is perfect, camera quality 100% This product is a 10/10 recommend. I want to say thank you to the supplier for not ripping me off and I appreciate you for that.",Positif
"It started out where it would say no service in areas that i had service previously and I am disappointed in that. Now almost 9 months later, and the phone will die so quickly. The battery barely lasts. I am pretty upset. Sometimes it will die at 6% or so. Overall I am not impressed and would not recommend as a solid day-to-day phone. I wish the battery was not so bad.",Negatif
"The only problem so far with this phone is the camera sound cannot be turned off. We will probably return the phone because of this, it would have been nice to know this when purchasing,
Update:
We were able to return this phone very easily. We ordered another one from a different seller and are very happy with the second phone.",Positif
"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, I bought one and it was not working. I have used the charger provided in the package in different power outlets, I tried a different charger from another iphone 6 that was working, and nothing happened. I am VERY frustrated since I live outside the US, I am having a TERRIBLE headache returning the phone and getting a refund for shipping internationally. Buy from a different seller, or go directly to an Apple store.",Negatif
"After four months of owning the phone, it shut off and would only enter recovery mode. I brought the phone to the Apple store. They told me that the whoever owned the phone prior tampered with it. Additionally, they mentioned that there was a hole in the phone where on a normal 6s there is no hole. Highly disappointed in the lack of quality and inspection in the refurbishment and will never waste my money again with this seller.",Negatif
"I purchased the unlocked IPhone 6s in Space Grey. Thé delivery was prompt and I received it a day ahead of the estimated delivery date and it came with a screen protector in place along with a charger. I am using this phone internally on a GSM carrier and I had no problem with the SIM or provider. The screen and back are scratch free, however when the screen is powering on/off it has a red hue in the lower left corner. And the battery life could be better. When I received the phone it said it was running on 80% battery life. A little disappointing.
Overall the phone works great.",Positif
I was really happy for the phone. Initially I had no problems. I set it up and everything appeared to work. I charged it to full and it seemed to hold the charge. After I turned it off and packed up to present it for Christmas things didn't go right. My daughter would have it and the battery would drain within 3 hours. I am going to just have the battery replaced due to I don't want to chance getting another defective one with worse problems.,Negatif
"For one, this phone is not virgin mobile compatible even though it pops up when you type in virgin mobile phones.
Secondly, the phone was dirty. Something sticky like a booger on the power button and the screen was all smudgy. I know it's refurbished, but it feels like a 12 year old refurbished it. Will be returning it, lesson learned.",Negatif
"I bought two of these phones. One came as good as new, the other one not quite. The main microphone does not work during calls but It does for taking voice notes. Also there is no way to silence camera shutter sound due to the fact that the phone came with an asian software version. It also came with lots of dirt inside both the power and the headphone connectors. Unfortunately I was able to try phone calls when I got back to my country and now I dont have the chance to take it back and ask for a refund. I regret not having bought the Galaxy S7 in B&H. One extra star because the rest works just fine.",Negatif
"The battery does not hold a charge, if used, for a day. It was disappointing. I called and emailed the Certified Refurbisher and received no response. I initiated the return and still no response. I am surprised that this product made it through quality control.",Negatif
"This phone worked initially but almost exactly to the day, 6 months later, when the warranty was up, it stopped working. the battery won't hold a charge. It overheats. I even had the battery replaced 3 times and replaced the charging port and it still will not hold a charge. I expected a $400+ phone to work loner than 6 months.",Negatif
"We found out that the phone was defective when we went to turn it on with our carrier. So, we took the phone to the only Apple store in town and had to wait for hours for them to tell me that the antenna was broken. They were unable to tell us anything for certain, without taking the phone apart, which would cost even more money. We ended up trading it for something else. To make matters worse, this was the only thing our son asked for for Christmas. Never again!!!",Negatif
"Received with several small white spots on screen, seems to be common problem wit refurb units. No other problems in 2 months I've had it, decided to live with the spots and hope they don't get worse.",Positif
This phone completely shut off after 3 months of using it. Throughout the night it turned ff and never turned back on Luckily I had an upgrade but thank you amazon for selling me a half working phone.,Negatif
"iPhone 6s came in a good condition. The box it came seemed to be used a lot. Looked like a box to send iPhones for repair. The phone itself came in an almost perfect condition. The preowner was probably using a protection screen. The screen came without scratches in that area where the protection screen was placed. Right next to it little scratches on the glass, but totally acceptable. USB cord and plug came brand new. No ear plugs. Housing was also without scratches. At the end ""all good"" !",Positif
So far so good.. phone was clean..shopping was as expected. But will write full review over the next few months to make sure all components are lasting..,Positif
"I've had the phone for a week now. It works great, normally, I was able to set it up like a normal iphone and YES it works with cricket wireless!
I just plugged in my old sim card from my old iphone(i had an iphone 6s that broke), and once I set it up I was able to text and call immediately with no problems.

The battery life seems fine, no scratches or major cosmetic issues it seems like a normal iphone. There is one small dent at the bottom next to the speakers but that's to be expected since this is refurbished, but you really don't notice it at all, and can be covered with a case.

I will update if anything goes wrong!",Positif
"Battery on this iPhone had to be replaced with less than 10 months of use.. I'd suggest checking the battery life indicator upon receiving the shipping and return it if it less than 99%...

Otherwise the phone works as intended, device came with no scratches and no dents.",Positif
"Well it's been a solid few months since my purchase and I've got to say I'm completely satisfied. Works perfectly. Really nice, sleek and feels new. I immediately bought a case and screen protectors so I've had zero problems so far.",Positif
"Love this phone. I shattered the screen of my iPhone 5 and this phone has been a lifesaver! Looks BRAND NEW, was so easy to set up (I have Verizon), and is a great price. I was really trying to avoid paying for a phone that is $800 on a monthly payment plan over 2 years just to need a new phone again at the end of the 2 years and with this phone I was able to avoid that. Definitely recommend!!!",Positif

 Working smoothly! I'm using it as a wifi-only device and didn't realize I'd need to get a SIM card in order to activate it. My review shows how to add a SIM card to the device.",Positif
Do not buy from this seller a couple after receiving this phone it has stopped working. First the battery wouldn’t charge had to buy a new charger cord then the phone just stopped working. This seller is selling defective products DON’T WASTE YOUR CASH!!!!!!!!,Negatif
"I've bought this item to gift one of my very close person. After opening,it was found the Sound is not working, not able to hear any sounds. No Music, Phone rings or any sounds !! Absolutely dissatisfied with this. Need to take this to the Apple store and spend $125 to fix the problem .It created a lot of shame for me for giving such a painful gift to someone. Never buy it from this seller, total waste of money.",Negatif
"They phone is in great shape. But the ba3 life is bad, Dies after 4 hours. I noticed it couldn’t do screenshots n send directly to other applications like Wat’sapp. But if u can take a screenshot (screenmunch) then move to Wat’sapp n look for the pic u just munched, Then u will be fine. Don’t take the delivery timing serz. Always check coz I got charged ( it read deliver by Monday, then it came on Saturday ) other than that. Ur good. The phone is great ????",Positif
Awesome phone! Easy setup at the AT&T store with absolutely no issues!!,Positif
"This phone started to go crazy after 2.5 months - the speaker would turn into darth vader voice and echo wildly. Unfortunately, couldn’t return it any longer. Scam of a refurbished phone.",Negatif
"Mostly works like a perfect new phone. But a few times when I try to make a phone call there would be just a terrible, loud static noise coming out of the speaker. The problem goes away when I restart the device. I hope it doesn't turn into a bigger problem in the future.",Positif
"I received my iPhone 6s from DealFisher a little over a week ago, and honestly I couldn’t find any signs that it was refurbished. I can’t find one thing that would differentiate my refurbished iPhone 6s from a new one. The battery life and overall speed of the phone (internet connection, switching apps, etc.) are like new as well. I did notice the speaker has a slight “crackle” when the volume is all the way up, but only on loud music or videos. The iPhone I received was in a generic box, it came with an aftermarket lightning cable and power adapter, which does the job. So far, I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.",Positif
"The phone is great, looks like new. It has a little scratching on the back but nothing to noticeable. Works really good so far. I bought it from DealFisher and it met my expectations. Comes in a generic box with generic charger and cable, no headphones but that is no problem for me. I will update after a few days of use and a few pics of the scratche.",Positif
"Phone arrived in good cosmetic condition for a refurbished phone. However, after one week of use the battery lasts about an hour. Sometimes less. We now have to spend more money to get the battery replaced.",Negatif
"This phone was terrible. It had a defective battery and would shut off constantly. I called Apple to trouble shoot and they said that the product wasn't even registered under the right serial number and that I should return it as soon as possible. Unfortunately I had to wait until I could replace it before I was able to attempt to send it back.

I highly regret making this purchase on Amazon.",Negatif
"Sooo I’m currently writing this from my new iPhone 6s. Before anything I say, it’s important to note that I purchased from Dealfisher. The iPhone came with some minor scratches on the edges, which were covered by a case just fine. The screen is great, no scratches and everything works. I haven’t tried to activate it and get service yet so I’m not sure how that will go, it took my SIM card on the first try though. It came with a generic charger in a generic box. No SIM card removal tool or earphones. I would definitely recommend this product so far.",Positif
"I got this phone from TechVenture. I ordered this phone on a Wednesday and the estimated shipping was from Next Tuesday to Next Thursday. However I got the product Monday, a day earlier. The products looks and works like brand new. No sign of use. I was able to add service to the phone with no problems. I love my new phone.",Positif
"We ordered 2, one for myself & one for my husband. They both look & work like new. We couldn't find any scratches anywhere on them. Our only glitch was not realizing we'd need nano SIM cards but our carrier provided those at no charge. Love our new phones!",Positif
"Received phone on a Tuesday. Charged overnight. Wednesday morning, charge started to disappear as if it were counting down seconds. Didn't launch a single app, and the phone lost 50% of its charge in an hour of sitting on the desk.

Love the cheap price, will use some of the savings to buy a new battery and hope that it holds a charge better.",Negatif
"Received the phone without obvious quality testing. It would not register with my AT&T provider when I inserted my SIM. The SIM card worked fine in other phones. I will say to the return process was seamless, just delayed having a phone for a week.",Negatif
"its great! came in on time, and easy set up. looked brand new besides a few very minor scratches. overall a good product. though the iphone i received was manufactured in japan, and because of that the shutter sound doesn't turn off, AT ALL, because of their law. after some research, the only was to turn it off it to jail break it. at first i didnt mind but after about a half an hour i began to get really annoyed and just wanted to turn it off, but i couldnt. just be aware of the when purchasing.
bought mine from:BuySRPY",Positif
I am really happy with my purchase.,Positif
The first phone was lost in the mail and this phone wouldn’t stay on for more than 5-10 minutes and had to pay $60 for a battery. It wasn’t worth dealing with the $20 reimbursement or sending the phone back after it was programmed. It works now though.,Positif
Works,Positif
"One issue after another with this phone.
Does not delete texts. Have to keep touching screen to get it to open or close.Loses charge quickly, says can't send item to trash, touch contact to dial and nothing happens, touch contacts and phone locks up, texting someone and a readout says that they are not on!",Negatif
Was worried about a refurbished phone but this thing looks brand new not one scratch very happy so far was so new they let me put insurance on it when I brought it to ATT to have it turned on,Positif
"It works like a charm, looks and feels brand new",Positif
"Audio is bad, battery drain so quick(%5 drain every 30 seconds), screen freezes, restart by itself, you should sell this for 1 cent. Can’t even return it. So rediculous. Very bad phone. I’m buying the 6s from other sellers now. Theirs are way better than this.",Negatif
The phone itself is great. One very annoying thing is not being able to turn off the camera noise. It doesn't seem like a big issue but when you are taking pictures with friends it is extremely annoying. Apparently any phone from japan has this noise unable to be diabled.,Positif
This iPhone is not unlocked. Just bought this product and it does not work with my carrier in Brazil. What a shame!,Negatif
The phone is in perfect condidtion. It came with about a 20% battery. It also came in a brown box with an after market amazon basics charging cord and charging brick. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because shipping took almost a week and a half but other than that it's great so far.,Positif
The phone did not work properly. For regular phone calls you could only hear the person you were calling but they couldn't hear you and there was always a lot of static. The Facetime option worked a little. The seller didn't seem too concerned when we contacted her about the issues but we were refunded promptly.,Negatif
"arrived on time, exactly as described...I have a hard time paying the new price for these phones....great to save money and have the exact product you want",Positif
"Purchased for my mother and she absolutely loves this certified refurbished phone! It came as described without any cosmetic blemishes, charger block and cord. No headphones. Overall absolutely loved this phone!",Positif
I've never bought a used phone before but glad I did. This works perfectly fine and I saved a lot of money.,Positif
"Phone doesn't work, came without headphone. Tried 15 minutes, couldn't get the phone turn on.",Negatif
"Bought this phone, plugged it in to charge and its gets extremely hot, to the point that I can't touch it.",Negatif
"at first i was scared to buy a refurbished phone from a third party, but when i ordered this phone i was surprised by the quality the phone was in.
there were no scratches at all and the phone worked great! only downside was that the home button was stuck a little and hard to push, but after a while it fixed itself and is working great now. and the price is great too, it was way better than what i would find on third party apps like craigslist. overall, i’m very satisfied with my purchase. if i ever need a new phone i’ll definitely be checking these dudes out again",Positif
"The phone I feel like its new. Doesn't looks like a refurbished one. Also, i am a big time DealFisher sellers fan, so apparently their products are just amazing. Loved it.",Positif
The settings keep changing and the phone will shut off by itself. Plus battery percent changes.,Negatif
"Arrived in great condition. Was worried the phone wouldn’t work on Verizon network but was able to buy new sim that allowed full access. Arrived in aftermarket box. The power block doesn’t seem to work properly even though it states it’s “Apple approved” one quality. Still, it works great. I’d highly recommend this seller for future purchases of used Apple products.",Positif
"Received the phone quickly and packaged very professionally. The only issues we have seen so far is a faint scratch about 1 inch long in a corner of the screen and a pixel that is slightly discolored (but only with certain colors/brightnesses). Other than those 2 things, the phone looks and works great. Battery was a little lower capacity (85%) than I was expecting, but it's not worth exchanging for these minor issues.",Positif
"I purchased this phone as an upgrade from a 6 plus because my old iPhone had touch disease. I received the 6S and the battery life is garbage. Charges to 65% overnight, and steadily tanks during the day. Good working phone, but a bad battery will kill any review.",Positif
I’ve had this phone for about a week and one thing I noticed is that the battery life goes down really fast.. when I’m at school I have to charge it in every class because the battery goes down and remember I need it to last for 8...sometimes the phone cuts off by itself and once you cut it back on it changes your battery percentage..but it is a great phone came with no scratches and everything worked .. I would recommend this phone but at the same time I would,Positif
"It was delivered as-new, saved couple hundred bucks. What's not to like.",Positif
"Phone came a day early and with a screen protector , PLUS!!!! Phone looks and works like new , another plus!!!! Would definitely order again. WATCH CLOSELY FOR SELLER, IT VARIES WHEN YOU CHANGE COLOR OR STORAGE SIZE .",Positif
"Phone arrived in outstanding condition. Very happy with this product. I will most certainly order from you again. It even had a glass protective cover on it, added bonus! Thank you so much!",Positif
"I got my rose gold 64G iPhone 6s from Tech Venture a few days ago and it was easy to transfer all my information from my old phone to this new one. The phone came with a charger which was nice. There is some previous wear, like small scratches in the corners but nothing that concerns me. Phone works great and there doesn’t seem to be any problems.",Positif
"Phone had minor scratches on the back of the case, and a small flaw on the glass front toward an edge so it doesn't affect the display. After a couple of days of almost constant yay-I-got-a-new-phone usage, I detect no problems with battery life or operation. Getting my unlocked phone set up for my provider T-Mobile took an easy five minutes at their store. Seller BREEM shipped the phone with USB charging cord and 110v plug that are not made by Apple, but do their jobs just fine so far.",Positif
Excellent buy. The phone looked and worked as if it was brand new. It came with a power cord that fit and worked just great. It was easy to install. It didn't come with direction but you can always google the instructions. If you are looking for an iPhone 6s this is the best seller to get it from. I give 5 stars because I feel I got best deal with the price I paid.,Positif
"I ordered my phone from the seller BuySPRY, the phone delivered in 2 days (very fast for free shipping) & came like new. Looks new, sounds great & is working perfectly fine so far. Came unlocked. Would definitely recommend buying from BuySPRY. Love love love my new iPhone! ??",Positif
Volume button does not shut off the camera. Battery life came in at 90% And after 26 days it is down to 79%. I am sending it back.,Positif
"I purchased this product for my daughter and just after the 60 day warranty the phone stopped working. Prior to that the battery would not hold...we figured we would need to replace the battery since Apple sent out the notification; however, when we went to replace it, the repair man said the phone was broken and wasn't worth fixing....Money wasted and this seller is selling JUNK! Save your money and buy elsewhere. There is zERO PRODUCT SUPPORT HERE.",Negatif
"*UPDATE* I went to the Apple store to get my battery replaced, and they wouldn’t touch it, because there was a run down, after market battery installed. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!

The battery is totally run down- takes forever to charge, then immediately begins to lose charge. I paid too much money to be sold such a subpar product.",Negatif
Received the black iPhone 6s 16gig today. Inserted my Verizon SIM card and it started up no problem. No scratches on the screen or back on the phone. No dents or dings. Battery came 77% charged. So far so good. I will update only if the phone becomes flawed. Paid around $310.,Positif
"Upon arrival I charged the device to 100%. It sat unused overnight (approx 7 hours) and was at 1% when I picked it up. After recharging I used it to add contacts for approximately 10 minutes and watched the battery drop 21% in that short amount of time. I had the battery replaced by Apple ($30) and now the device works fine. Overall the device is great, but these shouldn't be sold with insufficient batteries. I wouldn't purchase from here again.",Negatif
"Although I like the 6s, in general, the battery on the refurbished one I purchased is on its last legs. It’s clear I’ll have to replace the battery within a month, so it was a bit of a false economy having purchased an older model. In retrospect, it might have made more sense to pay for a newer version, like the 8.",Positif
"This was my son's first big purchase. I was a little leary about the ""refurbished"" idea but so far it works great. He is super happy. I hope that he stays that way after the return window closes.",Positif
"The microphone doesn't work well (well talking on the phone it is very muffled), I should have sent it back, but was leaving town for ten days. Disappointed.",Negatif
"I was so worried buying a used IPHONE, but here we are 4 weeks later with no issues - it’s all good!",Positif
"At first I was very skeptical about buying this because 1. The bad reviews will have you worrying if you're getting a broken or unusable phone, and 2. Because it's used/refurbished. But after it came a day earlier and I finished unboxing it, I can say you're getting an extremely solid product, looked brand new, felt amazing, and runs smoothly. Certainly getting your money's worth. Just make sure you get a case along with it if you're a clumsy person like me.",Positif
"I bought this phone from BUYSPRY and so far everything has been perfect. It came with a screen protector, the phone and the charger but the charger didn't really work. The battery life is standard and there are no scuffs anywhere except for a tiny nick on the screen protector.",Positif
Actually impressed with refurbished purchase. Phone looks brand new and comes with extra thing you didnt even know would come with a phone like wall charger/car charger/free case. Yall actually outdid yourselfs gonna make another purchase again from them for myself since i bought this one for my sister.,Positif
Phone heats up. Battery defective.,Negatif
The battery died after using about week +. I do not recommend buying the refurbished iPhone unless it's directly from apple.com. I'm going to return it soon!,Negatif
i love it although i will admit i was on edge about buying this product because of all the mixed review i got the 16 gb rose gold by deal fisher the phone look and workes perfectly no scratches on it at all and i was easily able to connect my service to it hands down will by again if i break this one,Positif
The phone shut off with my data still on it so I cant send it back because it has my personal info that means I CANT RETURN IT. DONT BUY THIS!!! Tried dozens of solutions to what seems like an irreparable problem. The phone is destroyed from a software standpoint. Probobly has non-apple parts.,Negatif
"When I received the phone the battery was are two bars, however, when it died it wouldn't charge. This was a birthday gift and this was disappointing.",Negatif
"I purchase a reburbished unlocked IPhone 6s through Breed fulfilled by Amazon. I have had no issues and it was unlocked for any carrier. Just called and had it upgraded and it works great, knock on wood. It was in great shape with no scratches and came with a charger and nice box. Happy shopping!",Positif
"What I suppose from a refurbished device is it looks like a new one. I received the item in a very cheap package with Alcatel charger and one-foot black cable and no headphones. The battery life is around 3hours which is rediculous. It's more like a used item other than a refurbished device.
I am travelling in a day and I need an unlocked phone so I don't have enough time to get a replacement. I am really mad of the value I paid for it.",Negatif
Worked great and received as described.,Positif
"Zero issues with the phone and thr price was right .
I need to get another one and I am surly not doing through any cell phone company, why I never thought about this before . Glad for the available option.",Positif
"I bought this phone to replace my old one which was the same model. Everything works normally EXCEPT for the inability to shut the camera shutter sound off. I'm not able to respond to my Snapchats in public or at school because everyone hears the loud shutter sound. But other than that, it was an alright deal.",Positif
"The phone looked like brand new. Arrived in two days, as promised. Came fully charged. Purchased a SIM card for
Tracfone and I was off to the races! Everything transferred over smoothly.",Positif
So this would have gotten a 5 star review but my phone seems to be sourced from Japan and my camera makes shuttle sounds regardless of being in silent mode or not. While in Japan it is illegal for your camera not to make noises when taking pictures it is however legal in the US. So being a US consumer this sucks!,Positif
"Phone works well, though I did have to change a battery because the one I had was burnt out. Phone sometimes has volume trouble. Like during phone calls the speaker fades in and out. You get exactly what you pay for here.",Positif
I have had my phone for a few months now and I don't have any issues with this phone. It was easy to set up with my phone number. It was great for the price.,Positif
"The battery shows a little bit of age, as it doesn't have that fresh long-lasting and quick-charging performance that a new phone has, but otherwise this phone is pristine and fantastic.",Positif
Shipping was super quick and my phone was unlocked and able to use with Verizon. I love my new phone and I have no issues. I’ve had my phone for a week and it was sold from ekings.,Positif
"I got my phone and everything seemed perfect about it, until I'd have phone calls and people would say that they could barely hear me. So I tested it out by recording with a lot of background noise, and everything sounds so mumbled and far away. I really need this to be replaced. It's frustrating making important phone calls to my boss and having her tell me we'll talk later because she can't understand me.",Negatif
Did not have a good experience with this. I got this phone and it was working fine until 1 month later it stopped getting any service AT ALL. Do they even check these phones before sending them out? Who knows.,Negatif
"Bought this phone as a birthday present for my boyfriend. Seems to be overall good phone, good battery life and regular response speed, although it’s unfortunate that the screen has minor problems such as not registering when buttons are held down when recording video it will randomly stop, seems to be a sensor issue. Overall a good phone besides that issue.",Positif
This was a gift for someone who lived in India. At first I was skeptical that it was not unlocked but they were able to put the foreign chip and it works perfectly,Positif
"In the past I had iPhones and then switched to an Android. I'm glad I switched back to an iPhone. It has been more reliable for me. I bought an Otter Box case and haven't broken it yet. The phone was in good condition, and I'm happy with it.",Positif
"Hello. I purchased this phone on Sunday on got it Wednesday. I was really scared because it’s a GSM Unlocked phone and i Have Verizon. I got the 16gb GOLD one and when i received the phone, it was well packaged and look great, not a scratch or anything. I then out my Verizon sim card in and boom worked. i’m not using a GMS unlocked iPhone on Verizon a CDMA carrier, which adds value to the phone.",Positif
I just received my phone and it is BEAUTIFUL! I honestly could not tell if it was refurbished or brand new. The only thing I could find was a couple teeny-tiny scratches on the back- I mean they are so small. The phone arrived in 2 days with standard free shipping! Very happy with this product and will definitely be ordering again!,Positif
Love this phone. It came on time and looked like new. My at&t SIM card works great with it. I haven’t had any issues. Been using it for a month now. Do not regret this purchase,Positif
"I was nervous ordering a phone from unfamiliar buyers, but when it came in it was brand new. Perfect condition, no scratches, no dents, nor smuges, nothing. However, it did not come with a key to open the compartment to insert the SIM card. No worries though, just used a paper clip to open it.",Positif
The phone is a great phone BUT the battery is the worst. I have to charge it at least 5 times a day. Once the phone is 100% it takes 5min-10min to go to 60% and less than one hour to be fully discharged. I need to carry my powerbank all day long. It's a pain in the AUSTIN. If you get one phone with good battery then you win the lottery. I'll probably buy another phone. There's been 5 days I have this thing and I already can't take it anymore.,Negatif
"This phone is beautiful, works fast, looks like new however, this was a gift for my mother and she says the phone’s battery is dropping pretty quickly. It went from 100 to 71 within an hour or so. Not sure if this phone needs a battery replacement already or something.",Positif
Great Christmas gift such a deal and for a great price the best phone on the market for 6s comparing to other prices of phones and it’s such a deal,Positif
The battery drained in 2 hours and the phone would die at 25%. It would constantly freeze and was completely unreliable. Happy I returned it and went to Verizon to get a new phone.,Negatif
Bought this to replace a Google Nexus P after boot loop. No complaints except for picture quality. Good buy,Positif

We bought this phone in January 2018. We have been having problems out of the battery since may now it doesn’t even come on....,Negatif
Very disappointed with the quality of phone. Ringer is not working after few days of use. It goes on Mute even without hitting side Mute Button which means you wont hear ring bell if someone is calling you. This is very bad since it can be very damaging in an emergency situation. I contacted Seller for help with changing the phone but there was NO Reply from the Seller. I strongly recommend not to buy this product again.,Negatif
"Iphone is in good condition, but I can tell the screen was replaced because the colors are not exactly the same as other iphones and the light sensor for brightness isnt working :(",Positif
"Great poduct, came with lightning cable and earbuds from apple. Not some offbrand earbuds or charger cable. I bought the silver 16 GB one and it delivered over the weekend from new jewsey to california. I was kind of sketchy about this one at first glance because of other reviews but the phone runs smooth and fine. But do pay attention to who the seller is when u buy this product bcuz it changes around alot. 4 star rating because it said it would deliver in 2 days but took 3. ~??",Positif
It is a great buy. I like the phone so much. It is like a new. I bought it from PLATINUM DEALS. Their service is wonderful. The seller has a very professional customer service.,Positif

"Perfect, just what we wanted. the description is consistent with the product, and using it in panama.",Positif
Phone came in great condition but a huge upset was that the Touch ID does not work properly. Very upset with this. Not having to Touch ID that works properly is extremely annoying.,Negatif
This order arrived as promised in great condition fromChubbiestech and the phone is in execellent like-new condition. Not able to review the battery life as I’ve only just charged it up for first time use. Phone came unlocked as advertised and setup was done in minutes. There were visible scratches or marks on this item. Very satisfied and would glad order other items and recommend Chubbiestech.,Positif
"The phone came on time, and there were no obvious blemishes on the outside. However, the battery is garbage. I am aware that iPhone batteries are already considered to be on the lower end, but this is not something to be explained by that. The phone will die at !00%, 40%, 100% on the charger, you name it. It never stays on, and I have to be connected to an outlet for most of my day, plus carry around a portable charger if I want even ten minutes of use.",Negatif
Was kinda lerious at first after ordering and noticing some more of the bad reviews but once I got it it seemed like BRAND new with one very very small scuff mark on the back from setting it on a table perhaps and no scratches on the screen very pleased and arrived 4 days early,Positif
"phone seems to be ok initially, however after using it you realise that it drops signal, battery has to be charged every day calls are unclear , pics are dark and blurry, this is my first time purchasing an iphone its not worth all hype that comes with it.i gave i a 3 cos my samsung J7 was a better phone in all areas",Positif
Phone looked brand new and had no cosmetic flaws. Battery life seems to be great so far as well! Couldn't be happier,Positif
"Works super well for a refurbished phone! The battery is still decent even though the phone was previously used. The screen looks as if it’s brand new and the tempered glass came already placed on the phone so that was nice. The phone has a few dings on the back which is to expected of something refurbished. Overall, I am incredibly satisfied with how everything came and the condition of the product for the value I got!",Positif
"Great product and service from seller DealFisher. There was an issue with the battery on the original phone I received. The seller was professional in handling the situation, and a new/replacement phone was sent promptly. The new phone looks great (so did the original), and I had no problem activating it. Overall very happy!",Positif
"The iphone was in perfect condition...beautiful. No scratches, marks or blemishes of any kind. I had some other issues with the phone and had to return it, but the 2 people I spoke with at Kanga Supply regarding the return were very helpful and great to talk to. Would use this Seller again.",Positif
Refurbished iPhone 6S delivered must not have been tested prior to sending. Battery life would go from 100% to 0% with less then 1 hour of use. Battery test shows 95% life but would discharge within an hour. Called and customer service did not seem to care and offered $20 or just send it back. Very frustrating since took me a while to move all my apps etc to this phone only to find out that it was a piece of junk.,Negatif
"Seller has good communications, had to get new SIM card from ATT store and used computer to transfer contact names etc. work perfect",Positif
Perfect i had it for like 3 months waited to do this review to make sure it was a good phone . Works perfectly fine ??.,Positif
It came with the battery at low health so it doesn’t hold a charge all day but overall solid phone the battery has been recognized by apple as a deffect,Positif
"I wanted to wait to give an honest opinion/review. Got this for my daughter because I had one from my job. Arrived in great condition. Seller had a signature resquest upon delivery which was kind of a pain but at the most was the best thing that they could do so that my product was delivered safe and TO ME. So far she still loves it, no issues, or doubts. This was actually loke brand new! I forgot if I ordered a refurbish or brand new phone.... that says a lot!",Positif
"The phone itself is just fine which is good! The speaker that mine has though sounds shot out and garbled, but the seller gave me the option to return the item for a full refund if that’s what I wanted to do which I really appreciate! I still need this one for now though, because it’s my only mobile phone for work and such, so I will have to purchase a new one to replace this new one.",Positif

"Love it! It has literally no scratches, it looks brand new and came with a screen proctor on it. I was a little nervous because of the mixed reviews but I couldn’t be happier that I decided to buy it!",Positif
Using this as my daily driver for over two years and it still works great. Only downside as with all iphones is the battery life :(.,Positif
My first time writing a review just so people wouldn’t go what i went through trying to find a good review. Good phone. I haven’t yet put a sim card in it but looks fine. The only little thing is that the bottom of the phone has a couple scratches but nothing major. Good product from tech venture.,Positif

For some reason the antena goes on and off. So it very difficult for me to stay online on the road. Unless I’m in a WiFi spot. Please I would to ask for an exchange as soon as possible.

Thank you",Negatif
"I normally don’t write reviews, but I am so pleased with this purchase. I bought two iPhone 6s 64gb phones from this seller for my twins 13 birthday. The phones work perfectly and were in almost perfect condition. There were small scratches near the home button, but it’s a refurbished phone so I didn’t expect perfection. These phones exceeded my expectations and I have two very happy 13 year olds!",Positif
"Absolutely awesome phone, no complaints. Ordered one more for my sister hope its going to be good as well!",Positif
My husband loves it,Positif
I am unable to use cellular data which is a pain. I can only iMessage and use the internet on WiFi. Phone is in good condition and works well otherwise.,Positif
This phone came looking brand new! I’ve been using it for about a month now and everything is going perfect. It even came with a screen protector on it,Positif
Came in perfect condition with an apple charger! Took it too Verizon and got SIM card installed super quick and easy. I debated so badly about ordering this phone.. but it ended out being amazing!,Positif
"After a couple of weeks of use, I can say that the phone works as specified.

PROS:
1. Phone arrived in excellent condition. It was shiny with no scratches or dents.
2. No slowdown or battery issues.

CONS:
1. They gave me an aftermarket iPhone charger.",Positif
"This product is very good, I had an amazing time with this phone and at a very good price, the phone was phenomenal. As this was my first Iphone I didn't expect much, I only wanted it to make calls and text and the screen to be big enough for my hands. It did all of this and more, I must say that work was very amazingly done on this phone, now if you'd like to know why I gave it one star I will tell you this.The relationship I had with this phone didn't work out. On the first day it worked perfectly fine, on the second day it would overheat and take a moment to come back on. On the third day it did the same thing mulitple times with very little use, on the fourth day it cut off for a few hours with very little work done with it. on the fifth day it cut out entirely and didn't come back on until two days later. Don't buy this product, save your money, buy an android.",Negatif
"A year later its still going strong! Good battery, perfect physical condition and it works. Was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. Thanks WBB LLC.",Positif
"Received my iPhone 6s 64 gig this week. I was expecting a few knicks and dings on the phone but to my surprise, it was immaculate. It even came with a free screen protector already installed. works just like a new phone as well, I am a very satisfied customer.. Will definitely be purchasing form Chubbiestech again.",Positif
"The phone functions great, but I’m incredibly irritated that apparently the phone was manufactured in Japan where the phones legally have to be designed so the camera sound is on at all times. It says absolutely nothing about this here and I’m very frustrated by this. The sound cannot even be turned down, and it’s incredibly loud. It bothers me and people around me and I’m really annoyed that it didn’t say this anywhere on the page about the phone.",Negatif
"Bought the phone 2 weeks in and it's still perfect. Everything works. No scratch or dent or wear and tare. Looks brand new, but its refurbish. My daughter loved it. It's exactly what I got through the mail. Unlock and I can use it through tmobile. I've recently bought it off another buyer,it said it was unlock but when I got it phone was not unlock so I had to return it and they gave me a full refund. Other then that, it was a 3 weeks waiting period for the return and the refund.

If you're thinking of buying one from this seller, I would recommend it.",Positif
It was exactly as expected. Zero complaints or suggestions.,Positif
"I was really scared ordering a refurbished phone since the reviews were mixed but I’m really happy!

No scratches or anything, the phone starts up perfectly!

It even came with a screen protector on the phone along with an Apple cord and charger. So far so good and if this isn’t updated than you’ll know i was happy with the phone :)",Positif
The product said to be refurbished. I dont mind the aesthetical details such as dents and scratches but I DO care about receiving a said to be refurbished cellphone that has a battery that lasts only a few hours and even shows in the battery stats to only hold 78% of charge. Having known this i wouldnt have bought it but since i live in Argentina i cant even give it back...i guess i’ll have to spend extra money and buy a new battery.,Positif
"Purchased this iPhone 6s as a gift. The recipient, who has had this device for 2 months, is extremely happy and hasn't any issues with it at all. In the future, if I were in the market again for same type of device, I would definitely consider a refurbished option.",Positif
"I bought this iPhone in April 2018 and it is now officially dead, 3 months later... The Apple Store tried to restore it but failed to. It seems to be a USB issue. There was a time when Apple was famous for its reliable products, wasn't there?",Negatif
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it, it looks just like new. As it is refurbished you don’t get original accessories and no ear phones, but I don’t mind it as long as the condition is fantastic. No signs of use. The product is as described.
I will again post review after using it for few days regarding its performance.
.",Positif
"Very disappointed.
the description said it would have some scratches.
it had none this phone exceeded my exceptions very happy it looks new
completely in love with phone
mind you i was very skeptical but omg im so happy
highly recommend",Positif
It can in pretty nice packaging and the quality of the device is better than I expected. A minor gripe is the battery capacity is 89% which is still completely usable but it would have been nice to get a completely new one for the price,Positif
"Bought in August, and now it's completely dead. It goes into an eternal cycle of re-booting itself, turning itself off, turning itself on. Have taken it to an Apple store and an iPhone repair specialists -- no dice. This was a total rip-off.",Negatif
"This is my first time buying a phone online and I was skeptical but I’am so glad I purchased my phone through Amazon and Dealfisher! Everything works perfectly, and I easily transferred everything from my old phone to this phone! I would recommend everyone to buy their phone through Dealfisher??",Positif
"The phone is in great condition, I did read the reviews where the phone wouldn’t even turn on at all and what not but I took a risk and was rewarded. It does take a while to charge and the power drains quickly. I just got it so we’ll see how it goes.
Update: It’s been a little over a week and the phone is still great. The charging issues was resolved when I got a new charging cord. Love my new phone.",Positif
"Totally impressed with this seller Chubbiestech. My phone arrived a day early, by certified signature mail. The box and phone look totally new. I changed out my sim and.....up and running instantly. I was not expecting it to include a glass screen cover already placed on screen, a sim removal tool, and a hard case. I broke my last phone dropping it without a case or screen protector. These little things mean a lot.",Positif
The phone volume cannot be heard! It exactly stopped in 90 days (just after warranty),Negatif
"As expected. As new not a single scratch. Unlocked, using it in Europe. Been using it for 2 weeks now everything works fine. Got it from DealFisher. As mentioned here in other reviews no box and no original accessories but that was expected.",Positif

"Better than expected. I removed sim from old 5s, downloaded backup from iCloud and done in 1/2 hour. Like new phone at 1/3 price.",Positif
"Unfortunately, this phone did not come unlocked, making it pretty useless for me. The company that sold the phone sent me an e-mail asking me to call them, but the number they gave me didn't work. I had to return it. Just be warned that your phone might not be unlocked.",Negatif
The phone works perfectly. No scratches. Even came with a glass screen protector. The battery is so much better than my old iPhone which tells me this one is fairly new.,Positif
GIVEN A PHONE THAT HAS REMOTE MANANGEMENT ON IT BY EVANGELICAL GOOD SAMARITAN SOCIETY. NOW I CANT USE THE PHONE. DONT BUY. PHONES ARE STOLEN.,Negatif
"I didn't notice any difference that it wasn't a new iphone, the looks, the performance was exactly like brand new, I was impressed!",Positif
The product says it is completely functional. But the slider doesn’t work at all. It doesn’t move. I checked it with the expertech and they confirmed that it doesn’t work no matter what. I should pay 85$ to fix it. I don’t have time to return it and get a new phone. I had to take it. Very disappointed and would never buy from this seller or recommend this seller to anyone.,Negatif
"I bought my iPhone from dealfisher. I paid 250 in total and overall I’m satisfied. It looks like new and the phone itself works properly. The reason I’m giving it four stars is that the battery runs out extremely fast which is probably why the original owner gave it back, but I got what I paid for, so I’m not mad.",Positif
"I gave this iPhone to my grandaughter for her 13th birthday yesterday. She was ecstatic!! So far, so good!!",Positif

"The quality of the phone is like new, no stripes or hits, seems like new.
It did not come with headphones and the charger is not original.
The battery is not lasting much but that could be an iPhone general issue.
The touch of the screen works perfect and in general everything is working as new.",Positif

If I'll find another offer I'll buy another one for sure. Thank you!",Positif
Perfect phone ! It came like new basically no scratches or dents ! It worked with cricket right out of the box. Came with third party charging brick and lightning cable but I don’t mind. I just ordered something else and I’m excited !,Positif
"This screen is good and not that much scratches but the ear piece (phone calling thing) was very white and full of dirt. I removed like 40 percent of by using a q tip but here's the other thing, on the top of the metal part it looks like there's an indent. I will take pictures.",Positif

I’ve just started using this phone and it is wonderful. I’m not rating five stars because I don’t know if there are issues that might arise in the next few days/weeks. Battery life is remarkable in comparison to my previous iPhone 6 that did have the battery replaced. Phone is unlocked and works great for me with TMOBILE in Germany.,Positif

"I bought this phone and immediately noticed it has a HUGE scratch. No big deal, what sucks is the battery. It won’t keep a full charge for even an hour.",Negatif
Received two das ago. Had some hiccups in the beginning.

"Hi everyone,
First of all the product is not like new. It has tiny scratches on the screen as you can see in the pics. Besides, ONLY the middle surface of the screen has fingerprint and keeps dirt on it, i think it is weird. There is also a scratch on the silent key. Apart from these the product is as described. It's factory unlocked. A1688. I like the product, it's very good product for its price.",Positif
"It works fine but sometimes the screen freezes and when I activate the silent mode sometimes the phone keeps vibrating.
On one of the outer sides it has a mark that looks like a small bang. The cable that came in the box is not original. If I lived in the United States (I live in South America), I would probably ask to change it.",Negatif
"The phone itself came in great condition physically speaking, but everything else was terrible I could not use my SIM card in it at all. The screen wouldn’t let me touch it until I turned the phone off then on again. And then it wouldn’t let me sign in to the apple store even though I changed my password and did everything right.",Negatif

I purchased this iphone 6s back in February 2018. Started having static in making calls ever since to the point that callers or I can not hear each other.

I saw some people say don’t order from “breed” but I couldn’t disagree more. My phone came earlier than expected. Packed properly and with a charger.

Highly recommend this phone and the seller.,Positif
Nice phone - came with very little sign of former ownership!,Positif
"Theres not much to say about iphones at this point. The product is in perfect condition and complies with the description provided by the seller. It came in a generic box which is to expect in refurbished items. However the description should also state that the accesories provided are not originals. The charger is very cheap, it didn't came with earplugs, but for this price it's something you can overlook.",Positif
The phone came out of the Apple box with a different charger. There was also a scratch on it.,Negatif
Works good and runs good I have metro pcs and have not had any problems so far. It has literally like 2 small dents but it's overall smooth and clean. 5/5 for this man great prices considering how much the other companies are charging. It also came with the USB and charger port ??????,Positif

I am requesting a partial refund, otherwise I will have to return the product and get a full refund. Please get back to me in one business day so I can resolve this problem, thanks.",Negatif
The battery did not last more than a few months. This phone was only used for wifi while at home so nothing overly demanding. The charger sent with the phone was non-functional as well. This would have been a good price point if I hadn't has these issues.,Negatif
Almost like new. I was concerned to buy refurbished but so far no issue. Happy with the phone.,Positif

Totally lived up to expectations. Way to go Apple!!!,Positif
"Looks and feels like new... but has a couple of major issues:
1. The phone heats up pretty bad with very little usage

After just over 1 month the phone locked up totally, showing the apple symbol constantly, even after plugging it into my computer and multiple attempts to restart the phone it was locked in the apple restart mode. I had to return it with all of my information still on it as I could not delete anything. Not a very secure feeling but I figured thats what I get for buying refurbished. I was still under the impression that this company stood behind their product but after seeing the $106 restocking fee I couldn't be more disappointed.

"Apple makes a great product, which we love. Don't really appreciate that a ""certified refurbished"" product did not have the battery replaced. The seller should have known that the battery was aged and no longer effective. The product works great except the battery is old and dies down rapidly. Since the price for this product was about $100 less than a completely new iphone 6s, and the cost to replace the battery is anywhere north of $75, I'd have to say it would be more productive to buy a new iphone (and get the new product warranty) instead of one of these ""certified refurbished"" units.",Negatif
