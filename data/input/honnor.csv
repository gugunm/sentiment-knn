"I bought this phone after finally having to give up on my iPhone 6's battery life. That thing barely lasted half a day and if I used something heavy like maps, it would be instant death. I wasn't sure what to expect from this phone, but I couldn't afford a pricey iPhone X or Google Pixel. I have been so far pleasantly surprised. I'd say this phone works better and faster than my old iPhone ever did. I can now open apps and type words into search bars without it having to think about it and my battery lasts all day long. It's also extremely touch sensitive, something I had to get used to after my less touch sensitive iPhone. I can't say good enough things about this phone. The only downside is the screen will be less crisp than a more expensive one and the camera isn't top of the line crystal clear. I've added a photo to give you an idea. Still this phone is great and definitely is an exception to you get what you pay for. More phones should be this reasonably priced. I will recommend to everyone who wants a new phone that feels like an expensive top of the line one but can't afford it. Also I had cricket and switching over was as easy as taking my SIM card out of my iPhone and putting it in this one.",Positif
"UPDATE (7/28/18)
The earlier performance issues I had have disappeared with Huawei's update to Android 8 - it is a snappy phone. So, from a screen, form factor, UI, and app performance (for the price) - it's a 5-star phone.

BUT.... What no ""professional"" review will ever do is tell you about the performance of the actual 4G radio itself - because that involves science. My experience is that when I transitioned from my Huawei Nexus 6P to the Honor 7X calling from my home tanked. I can hear the caller fine but they can't hear me. Because the Honor 7X is not a phone sold by the carriers, they don't support VoIP through the native dialer - so, many times, I have to resort to going outside to take the call or use WhatApp. For this reason, I'm demoting my vote 2-stars. So, if you're in semi-marginal coverage - be aware. (I also am starting to experience a lot of ""GPS Signal Not Found"" - which is highly annoying when I'm in mid-trip and depending on the directions).

UPDATE (2/18/18):
After having the phone 1 month, the one nit I have is with Android Auto on my Volt. Sometimes the 7x has problems keeping up (i.e. map screen is blank). The remedy is to reboot. But, I've had a love-hate relationship with Android Auto on my Nexus 6p too - not this particular problem but enough other things that makes me wonder how much real testing is done on the app. So, it's hard to say if it's the 7x or Google.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Unfortunately, my previous phone, the Nexus 6P (which was also Huawei-built) entered into the boot-loop of death this last weekend and I needed to get a new phone. Settling on a new phone is a life-decision for me because it's with me more than anything else that I own. I was looking for a short-term phone before the upcoming Galaxy 9 announcement and decided on the Honor 7x because of the reviews - the 7x was oxymoronically termed the ""premium budget"" phone. Once I bought a new flagship, I'd let the Honor 7x become a backup phone.

Wow - I was not expecting this phone.

What's great
* Built Quality - it feels like a flagship
* Snappy performance - enough said
* Headphone jack - I'm a big user of bluetooth, but many times I don't want the hassle
* Included case - another $20 that I don't need to spend
* MicroSD slot - I like the option of more memory without having to pay extortion pricing for embedded memory
* Low phone stress: At this price, I don't need to guard this phone like a Faberge egg (yes, I had to look up the spelling for that)

What's not great and why it doesn't matter to me (i.e. would I pay an additional $400+ to get these features)
* No Type-C: Yes, I'm trying to standardize on this but I've got plenty of microUSB devices now. I'm living in a mixed charger world for a while so I'm okay with it (but only this time)
* Not OLED: Yes, my Nexus 6P was brighter. But, fixing a cracked OLED cost more than this phone (so I lived with a cracked screen)
* Camera: I'm sure the camera isn't as good as the flagships but it doesn't move my $400 needle
* Bezel - it has a small bezel. Who cares.
* No fast charging: You need fast charging when your battery can't get you through the day - this battery will more than get you through the day
* No 5GHz WiFi radio: It's loading apps and streaming videos plenty fast for me now.
* No NFC: Since I can't depend on vendors accepting Android Pay, I've always got my credit cards with me.
* Not waterproof: I'll just continue to be careful with the phone.
* Not SnapDragon latest: As long as the performance is good - it doesn't matter.
* I can't remember how to spell Hawui: But, I feel superior to others in that I can pronounce it.

What's not great and may not matter to you:
* Comes with Android 7, not Andriod 8. Given that only .2% of devices were on 8 you probably don't care about this. For me, it's inexcusable for a manufacturer to release a phone on an old OS. This is why when I transitioned from Apple to Android, I settled on the Google Nexus because I knew I would always get the latest. As a tech enthusiast, when I read about a new software feature that's available, I need to have it. But, the reality is that, unlike the old days when new major versions of OS's contained exciting and life-altering features, the last set of major releases have been kind of a yawn-fest. But, it's still important to me and how Huewai keeps pace with the latest releases will be a factor if I choose them again.

Summing it up, great phone at a fantastic price. I would pay more if I needed to, but with the Honor 7x, it don't. IMHO, if you are buying a flagship phone from Samsung/Apple/Google, you're making a fashion statement.

(but, I'll let you know if I change my opinion)",Positif
"As far as size, looks, screen resolution and touch response, the phone seems excellent.

However, the only reason I bough this phone was for the dual-SIM capability. What Huawei and almost every other phone provider doesn't tell you (and it takes a LOT of digging to find out) is that the first SIM operates as you would expect (LTE/4G/3G), but the second SIM operates ONLY on 2G.

No big deal, right? WRONG. 2G is being phased out in the US. In fact, the cellular communicator for my home alarm system was 2G and ceased working 2 YEARS ago. There is no 2G in my area. Maybe there's 2G in your area (very few areas), but that won't help you when you travel nor will it help you when 2G finally ceases to stop working in your area (and it will).

You can switch which SIM is the active SIM through the phone configuration, but you will only receive (or make) calls on the active SIM.

If you need a phone with dual-SIM and 3G on the second SIM, the Samsung J7 and one of the Sony's will do it. Make sure you get the specific model, as there are multiple J7's.",Positif
"If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I like phones and test drive MANY in search of really good phones, were kind of s phone family. Having said that, I am a Huawei fan since the Mate 2. They just build good phones for an incredible price. We have owned all the high end Mates and everything since the Honor 5 to this phone, the 7x. I say that to say, I don't mind paying more for a good phone...but the Honor line has made it so I don't have to pay more for a quality phone with really good specs. I never would have imagined a $200 phone could be this good.

The photos are a side by side comparison to the Honor 5, for size comparison.

The first thing I noticed about this phone is how remarkably thin it is for an almost 6 inch screen, with three cameras (two on back, one forward facing) It's much lighter and thinner than the 5, yet feels more solid in the hand. This phone has a nice large battery and I'm sure it will last my husband all day, with moderate text and web use. It uses a micro USB charger, which is fine for most people who still have a ton of micro USB chargers around (I personally prefer type C, but my husband hates change and likes the micro USB). Even though the screen is almost 6 inches, it doesn't feel too large..and definitely feels smaller than my Mate 9. The screen is bright and the resolution looks great. ALL my husband's apps and data transferred over (all 64 apps) within 16 minutes with the phone clone app that Huawei uses for data and app transfer. The phone is super fast and switched between apps quickly with no freezing or lag (yet). The UI is typical Huawei, but you can download the google launcher or other launcher of your choice to give a more familiar feel. We use cricket (which is AT&T prepaid) and had no issues with the APN, it configured automatically. Placed a call and the sound was good and definitely loud enough on speaker.
The camera is good...it's not the Mate 9 Leica but it's good and I didn't feel the need to mess with any settings. Is plenty good for social media pics, selfies and pics of the kids, pets, life's most embarrassing moments, etc. It still has a headphone jack, which I prefer to an adapter or even wireless. The finger print sensor is lightning fast and works before you even realize you have pressed your finger against the sensor. Not too much bloatware, certainly not as much as carrier locked phones! It has 64 GB of space, AND room for a memory card. Comes with Android 8 which is pretty similar to 7, but nice to have updated out of the box. It encrypts the SD card so be aware if you choose this option that you won't be able to just pop your SD card out of this phone and into another without changing the settings.
Time will tell, but based on prior experience with Huawei, as well an Apple, Samsung and various bargain phones, I believe this is another keeper! It's a shame AT&T backed out of the deal to bring this phone to the carrier, but it may work to the consumers advantage by keeping prices competitive.
DAY THREE of heavy use and no glitches, lagging, freezing or resets.
Love this phone more worth each passing day.
Months later and I still believe this is the best sub $200 phone out.",Positif
"I waited to do this review until after using with the EMUI 8.0/Oreo 8.0 Android update, as the previous Nougat software had some lag issues. On my phone, these appear to be fixed now.

The phone is smooth and fast for everything I do everyday (I am not a gamer). I have not missed the extra gig of ram I would have gotten with the Huawei Mate SE or the international version of the Honor 7x. The fingerprint sensor is blazing fast and accurate. The new face unlock, not so much. It works about 70% of the time. But for me it's not an issue. The fingerprint sensor not only unlocks the phone but can be set for other things as well, like taking a pic or scrolling in some apps.

It feels like a much more expensive phone. Solid in the hand, very much like IPhone 7. The screen is bright and clear, with fairly good viewing angles, usable but not great in bright sunlight. The speaker is loud enough but a little tinny, but hey, it's got a headphone jack, and good sound though it at that! Calls are loud and clear, GPS works great.

I like EMUI 8. It's fast and pretty customizable, with lots of themes available on the Google store. But if you prefer something else, this is Android, so there are many other launchers available. I do wish they had kept stock Android's ability to move apps to the SD card, however. As it is, data can live there, but apps cannot. Still, I've got pretty much all the apps I'll probably use, and still about 12 gigs of space.

The cameras are great for pictures in good lighting, with lots of options and a good manual pro mode. In low lighting things fall off significantly. And video takes clear shots and great sound, but no optical or digital stabilization, and only 1080p, no 4k.

Downside? No NFC (so no Android Pay), A Micro USB port instead of USB-C. Charging not as fast as some others. No official waterproofing (though there are some YouTube vides that show it to be pretty resistant to an accidental dunk. Not going to test it myself). Still it is amazing how much phone you can get for under $200. I would recommend it to anyone who does not need ultimate gaming performance, Android Pay, or absolute top-level camera. Or, If the camera is the issue, Buy this, and use the money you save to buy a real camera.",Positif
"For $200 this phone is a absolutely a bargain. Pros: battery last long, screen are big resolution are good....
Cons: no 5G WiFi and speaker is a little weak, no Android 8.0 yet. The GPS chip is pretty junky, I don't use the gos often so it not a big deal to me, other than that its a perfect one for the budget I'm really happy that I bought it.",Positif
"I bought this phone on March 6, 2017, I received 2 updates, currently with Android 8, Emui 8. the only problem is the GPS, it does not work with Google Maps or Waze, it is a pity that a quality team like this present this problem",Negatif
"TL;DR: Great bang for the buck. The screen is solid enough, providing ""true"" colors, viewing angles a bit weak. Overall call quality is decent. The exterior design is modern, looks like a flagship device, thin bezels, however, a bit uncomfortable to hold, wish it was more curvy. Performance is great for the price to performance ratio, wish it came with 4 GB of RAM, like what the international model has... Camera is great for this price range, strong in good lighting, a tad weak in lower lighting. Wish the overlay of EMUI was closer to stock Android.

After much frustrations with the limitations of my Moto G, trying to run two apps at a time, it was time for a much needed upgrade. I'm not a ""power user"" when it comes to phones, I just need something that works for casual use, and that can be a handy tool.

For $200, you're getting a lot of phone, thanks to the popularity of the Moto G, phones entering in the mid range market with a lot of bang for the buck, and Honor 7x so far has shown that is what it intends to do. The design of the phone looks as well as those high end phones 2 to 3 times the price, and the screen, camera and performance isn't so far off from those flagships.
The screen being at 1080p, and nearing 6 inches is still very crisp, the viewing angles are a bit weak, and the colors are not as ""poppy"" as more expensive options, however... the colors seem to be ""true"" and not exaggerated, which I personally like. I'm glad this phone stuck to 1080p, I feel like the higher resolutions showing up on phones are not really needed, and just impact the overall performance, and battery life.

Motorola phones, always had awesome call quality, I expect my phone to actually be able to function as a phone, crisp voices, incoming and outgoing, but for some reason, many phones fail at this, *cough* iPhones *cough.* The call quality on this Honor 7x is not that bad, could it be better? Yes. It works, it's crisp enough, it does sound better than some higher priced phones for sure, but it's not at the same level as Motorola phones.

The exterior design takes some elements of the iPhone 6, in fact a bit too much to be fair, this could be a plus for some, a negative for others. Although it looks nice, and modern, I hate the flat design; it's somewhat uncomfortable to hold, might as well hold a brick, the first 3 generations of Moto E, G, X had it right with the curves that blend with the hand, I wish more manufactures took this approach to design.

The performance of the phone is pretty snappy, no complaints for the price. I've been hitting my head against the wall using my Moto G the last year. It's really nice to be able to go through multiple applications, and not get hold ups, I really hope the 3 GB of RAM can hold up for at least 2-3 years, I'm a bit bummed that the U.S. model didn't get 4 GB of RAM like the international model(s).

Cameras aren't super important to me, I don't have the desire to take a picture of every food dish I eat, of every tree I see, ect... I think for those moments I need to take a picture of video, the camera does pretty well; in good lighting, the camera does a great job, in lower level lighting, it's a bit weak. Compared to the god awful camera I've been using on the Moto G, this is personally a big (MASSIVE) upgrade in quality.

I like to start off with a pure, or nearly pure stock Android, I'm not a big fan of skins over Android, most of them impact performance, and always seem a bit messy in terms of U.I. EMUI adds nothing for me, I don't know if I will eventually root this phone and clean it up, and/or install a custom ROM, if any actually get made and working... For now, I just uninstalled any of the bloatware apps I could, and disabled the ones I don't use, replaced the EMUI stock launcher with Nova launcher, and added a bit of my own personal touch. I wish after all the bloat manufactures add to there custom skin, I wish that they would have a setting where you could not only customize your navigation keys, BUT FREAKING RESIZE THEM!!! In fact, I wish Google actually would add that setting to begin with…

Honor(Huawei) if your listening! Two features I would add to the software experience is the resizing of the navigation keys, and navigation gestures to the fingerprint sensor: swipe left to go back, swipe right to go to recent apps, swipe up to go home.

Overall, great device, I'm glad I decided to purchase it, rather than going with a Moto G5 plus. Hopefully the device will last me for at least 2-3 years without much headache.",Positif
"I wish I could give this phone 4.5 stars. It's not perfect but for $200 it's pretty close. The build is solid and the screen is suprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much for the price so it has exceeded my expectations. The only thing it doesn't have that I wish it did is fast charging. I haven't had it long enough to say how big a deal that is but it sure would have been nice. The other odd quirk I've found is that you can't transfer apps to the SD card. You can store files on it but not apps which is strange. Again, I'm not sure how big a deal that will be over time. For the price, at least initially, the phone is well worth it.",Positif
"Here's a review from a total phone newbie without all the fancy, smart lingo that usually comes with phone reviews.

My phone history: I was an apple user. Had four iPhones.

So it's a nice change... It was hard to get use to an Android phone after so many years of using iPhones but here are the pros:

1) Big phone. Great for games, watching things and browsing. You will need two hands.
2) Soooo much storage... more than I am used to. And you can add MORE storage? Sign me up.
3) Definitely durable and comes with a case. I tend to drop my phones. A lot. So it was nice they included a semi-transparent case and there isn't any (big) damages to the phone yet despite a little slip from my hands at least once a day.
4) I fell on the phone. This thing BENDS. It contorted to the shape of my butt. The glass made it out no scratches. I just had to bend the phone back to its flatten shape.
5) You can withdraw your texts a few seconds before it sends.
6) You can do split screens.

Cons:
1) Camera quality is horrible. Selfie camera produces blurry, or at least not very sharp pictures. The back camera isn't that great either. Colors come out looking overly-saturated and doesn't capture a lot of details like I'm used to with the iPhones.
2) You cannot delete system apps like shitty Google Duo app.",Positif
"This is a beautifully designed and impressively priced phone that I would be more than satisfied with if one crucial aspect was present... It is NOT unlocked. I have spent the past two days trying to locate the source of my problem with my carrier to understand why my phone will not connect to my network. I originally assumed it was an issue with my SIM card, but it turns out my phone is still ""locked"" and will not be supported by another carrier until I contacted the company to resolve the issue. I reached out to them and did not receive any response. It has affected my work and I wasted $200 on a phone I had considerable hopes for.",Negatif
"OVERALL - Great phone for the price. As of the date of this review, the phone is hard to beat in this price range. The mid-range processor can handle most app's and games without issue. However, there are some issues that'll be addressed below.

SOFTWARE - The software, EMUI 5.1, will definitely leave you polarized. You'll either like it or you won't. It has an iOS look and feel to it. I bought Nova Launcher Prime and use that as the replacement launcher. The Honor 7x is set to receive Android Oreo updates sometime in Q2 2018.

HARDWARE - The Honor 7x has Huawei Kirin 695 processor. It's mid-range spec and is definitely capable of handling the day in and day out's of your average consumer. I've been able to play each game I've downloaded flawlessly. My issue is that the phone gets very hot in the back right corner at the top after an hour or more of intensive use such as playing a game, and I'm assuming the processor throttles itself in response to the heat, which will cause a noticeable performance drop.

There also seems to be random performance drops unrelated to what app's I'm using or how long I've been using the phone. They're rare but when they do occur, they're very noticeable and annoying. Sometimes app icons will disappear and will only reappear when the performance stabilizes. Other times there is a noticeable delay in starting apps after clicking them. I can't really explain how or why it's happening because I've been unable to recreate the issue intentionally other than when playing an intensive game for an hour or more and letting the phone get very hot.

BUILD - The phone is beautiful and feels great in the hand. It's not slippery feeling but is very smooth. It feels very solid. I used to worry with my last phone that if I sat down with it in my back pocket, that I'd bend it. I've no concern of that with this phone.

CAMERA - The camera's are average at best. They're not terrible. They're not great. The front-facing camera will get the job done for selfie's as long as you have good lighting. The dual-camera setup on the back is is also decent. With proper lighting and a steady hand, you can get some decent pictures.

SCREEN - It's not an AMOLED but that's not really an issue for me. The black's aren't as deep or rich of course, but that's an acceptable loss for this price range. The screen does auto-brighten in day light, which makes it a little more easily used outside. My only complaint is that the screen is very, very sensitive to touch. So sensitive in fact that if I'm scrolling through the app drawer and barely touch the edge of an app icon for even a split second, it'll launch. Coming from an iPhone, the sensitivity difference is going to take getting used to.",Positif
"If you want a modernized looking phone that can do the basics like social media, web browsing and e-mails, but less than half the cost of flag ship phones; this is a phone to consider.

-Looking Sexy
Back of the phone looks very similar to an iphone 6/7 with horizontal antenna bands on top/bottom,and thin profile. But also has a fingerprint reader.

Front of the phone has a very nice with bezel-less 18x9 screen ratio

-Screen Quality
No AMOLED display. so you're not going to have the best HD/4K movie viewing experience. But the 1080p LED display is very high quality despite that. Unless you're really accustomed to AMOLD Quad HD displays you won't notice a significant difference especially if you watch lower quality videos like on youtube.

-Speakers/Headphone Jack
Speakers are basic. Have one bottom firing speaker. As long as you're mindful placing your fingers when viewing video horizontally you won't have any issue.

Sound coming out is similar okay. Doesn't have enough bass, but loud enough to listen to vocals of songs and podcasts in a quiet room.

Has a headphone jack which some $800+ flagship phones abandoned for blue tooth only (unless you have an adapter). Very nice inclusion for those who still use wired headsets

-Duel Sim/Micro SD expansion
Self explanatory. Like the headphone jack, missing from most flagship phones nowadays

-Camera
Produces very good photos in the right lighting conditions. Not going to produce the highest quality photos like the Pixel 2, Note 8, or iphone X, but decent enough to share photos on facebook or instagram without being criticized about the quality (unless your friends are really nit picky).

Duel camera makes for a nice Bokeh effect (where the background is blurred, making more focus on the subject). At times it can look a bit artificial though (especially if the subject is far away), but most of the time it does it's job well. You can adjust this post snap shot.

No optical image stabilization when taking pictures, so best not to move around a lot for a second or two after taking the snap shot. You can use the finger print sensor instead of on-screen capture button to take pictures. Have to turn this on from settings.

Video is good if you have a steady hand, and not walking/jogging while filming as it does product a shaking cam effect if you move around a lot

-Finger Print Sensor
Works 100% of the time for me with dry clean hands. Scans instantly, no need to wobble my finger back-and-forth or hold down for a second or two.

You can also use finger print sensor to take a picture, scroll down webpages, or press and hold to pick up a call

-Gaming
Can run most 2D/less graphic intensive games really well. For 3D, high graphic intensive games; frame rate might dip a bit depending on how much is going on screen.

The phone also doesn't have gyro controls, so for games that requires it; it's unplayable depending on how much is implemented

-Operating System
Runs Android 8.0. So up to date as of this review. There are some custom firmware, but it doesn't take away from core Android experience.

It's mixture of iOS and Android leaning a lot towards Android. So good transition if you're thinking of switching over

An awesome feature this phone has is ability to do twin apps. Great if you have dual accounts for one app as don't have to switch users every time.

There is some bloatware apps, but you are able to remove/delete them from your phone, but most are very useful in my opinion. Best to test it out before deleting

Scrolling through apps is very smooth. May get a half second stutter if you view webpages with a lot of things to load.

There's no performance issues even when multi-tasking

-Works With T-Mobile
Have Tmobile as phone service provider. Network data and phone calls come through fine in my area.

-What it comes with
Phone, Wall charger/cable, instructions, and case. The case is very basic and makes the phone scratch resistant (minus the screen) in case you put your phones and keys in the same pocket/bag. I recommend getting a replacement case if you're the clumsy type and drop your phone often

-Missing features compared to Flag Ship Phones
Being 1/4 the cost of most flag ship phones like the latest Samsung, Google and iphone. Some features are bound to be missing. Here's a list of what's not included compared to top of the line smart phones out there:

1. No NFC. Not able to make mobile payments or physical touch data transfers.
2. Not water or dust resistant. Can get around this with phone cases that provide these features
3. No gyro sensor. As mentioned before may restrict some of your gaming
4. No wireless charging
5. Uses Micro USB instead of USB type C
6. No fast charging. Takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge from 10% battery life. Battery can last up to 2.5 days as long if you're not a heavy user. Idle time on this phone is really good. If you binge watch Netflix, it'll last 4-5 hours.

Overall, very good phone that's able to hang with the big boys (flag ship phones) with Android 8.0, modern exterior design and ability to run the usual apps.

Super affordable and excellent phone for the price. Highly recommend to anyone who just need the basics when it comes to Android.",Positif
"Overall this was an amazing phone. Was. Rarely had issues with apps loading, switching etc. Had plenty of storage to hold pictures, music and apps. Fingerprint scanner worked great as long as you kept it clean, and your hands were not wet or too dirty. Dual sim worked perfectly and was little hassle to switch between the two sim cards. Picture quality is fantastic, although it would be nice for more editing options. Sound quality was okay with the speakers, but I rarely had issues using Bluetooth and the headphone jack. Call quality was about standard, nothing out-of-the-park. It was hard to find a decent screen protector for it because of the 2.5D screen, the tempered glass ones never stayed on, but the soft ones worked perfectly. Same thing with a case, there are not a lot of options out there for a case. Battery life was nice, only had to charge it about every other day, with Wi-Fi, mobile data, and location services on. Without those running, it was about 3 or so days between charges.

However, this phone has barely lasted a year before failing. I bought this in February 2018, and just now in December it no longer charges, no longer connects to a computer. There has been tons of dirt and grime buildup in the charging port, as well as the headphone jack, which constantly needed to be cleaned out, which will wear out the contacts inside the charging port over time. A case that covers those would have prevented that, but there are very few options when it comes to phone cases. In addition to no longer charging, the phone will not unlock once the screen times out. Pressing the unlock/power button on the side ends up rebooting the phone and shutting it down instead of unlocking the screen, even with a single press. The fingerprint reader will not work either.

Everything about this phone was nice, except for the lifespan. Save the money and put it towards a phone that will last longer than a year.",Negatif
"I've been using this phone for about a month and I really like it. The battery lasts a good deal of time (around two days with normal activity, or one day if I watch videos or play games often), it has a nice camera and memory capacity, and very convenient settings. I love the fingerprint sensor in the back, it makes super easy for me to unlock my phone. I also really like that it allows me to call my contacts only by saying their name; everything is very accurate.
By far it's been the best, yet the least expensive phone I've ever had.",Positif
"If you are the type of person who doesn't care about brands and trendy technology, and you just need a good reliable smartphone with a good camera THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU. I am a college student at UT and this phone is my saving grace. It does everything my friends iphones can do (minus facetime, but my friends and I use google duo). My phone also has more storage, a bigger screen, a longer lasting battery, and was a fraction of the cost of an iphone. I can go a whole day and a half without charging it. For the record, I'm not just being idealistic about the difference between iphone's and this phone. The reason I even had to buy this phone was because my iphone 7 was a piece of ______. I was barely able to use the phone for a week. It was sooooooooo glitchy and the IC chip or whatever was faulty (a problem apparently VERY common to Iphone 7s), so I couldn't even make calls, only text. However, the phone I had right before the iphone 7 was an honor 6, which I gave to my younger brother and after about 2 years of use is still going strong. So, I figured why not just get the upgrade of the honor I had. Now I finally have a phone that works well. I would give this phone five stars, but its just a little bigger than I expected, but that's not really a problem because I also ordered a rose gold case with one of those adjustable metal rings in the back and I just keep my middle finger in there all the time so I don't drop my phone (its actually quite comfortable). So yeah I hope this review helps you make a decision and save your coins.",Positif
"Love it at first, but 8 months into the ownership, screen starting to detached from body. I contacted support and they claimed it's a physical damage that will not be covered by warranty. I have been careful about my phone and never sat on nor dropped it. There is not a scratch on the phone and no crack on the screen.",Negatif
"It is a perfect phone ever. I have briefly used honor 6x preciously, but not impressed that time because of the low end body and laggy performance. This time I decided to give it another try due to the shiny body and ovehemeingly good review. It really didn't dispoint me this time. The display is even better than I thought when I got the phone. I have heard view angle issue of phone but I don't see anything noticeable. Clarity of display are top notch!! Even feel better than iPhone 7 or 8. The performance is greatly improved from last generation. What is even better is it flies after I turned on developer option and limit the background process.
I haven't tried the camera seriously, it is ok. But if care about camera, it is not the phone for you.
I don't really have too much cons for it. The micro USB ports, lack of fast charge don't seem like a problem because I have plenty of old cable and battery is well enough for serious one day use.
One con I have is that edge of the screen is not very sensitive , but not a big issue to me.
So seriously, even without considering the fact of price, it is still a perfect daily driver phone.",Positif
"I needed a phone, the price was good so thought it was worth a shot. It's only been a few days and I'm not sure if I will keep it. It has many good qualities but has some major problems that could make it unusable in the future. The first is the screen doesn't respond. Sometimes it takes several tries. Also battery life is short. I start my day at 7am and the battery is dead by 4pm. I'm not a heavy user and my 3 year old phone last longer even now. But I'll give it more time and see how it goes.
Update. It's only been a week and it has lockup twice once during a phone call, and went dark once and It was hard to restart. The thing that makes me sad is I really liked this phone. It maybe a defective one but not sure I'm going to take a chance a replacement.",Negatif
"The eye catching distinguishment for the 7X is that 18:9 aspect ratio screen for the $200 price point you are paying. But there is definitely more in this budget phone than just the screen. Inside the aluminium unibody holds a Hisilicon Kirin 659 chip with 3 GB of ram and 32 GB of storage. There is micro SD card support for added space as well.

And like all Huawei and Honor phones, the 7X runs a custom skin running Android Nougat called EMUI 5.1, which we’ve taken a look at often on this channel. I personally have grown used to EMUI and you can adjust the settings to make it more of a traditional android experience. Options are good especially for the budget field.

But going back to the screen, Honor is calling their 18:9 screen a “FullView” display which in laymens term translates to a 5.93 inch 1080p IPS display that has thin bezels on the sides. Viewing angles and colors reproduction are perfectly acceptable and are actually quite good for this price range.

Something else that is really good for the price is the build quality. We’re very aware that Chinese phones have been providing solid budget builds for years now, but never have they been easily accessible in the western markets. This is sold on Amazon, Bestbuy and basically every accessible electronics e-commerce. The only budget aspect of the hardware is the use of micro-usb instead of USB C. Although as I said before about this phone, I do suspect most potential buyers looking at the 7X are coming from a micro usb phone anyway. Its one extra cable you have to carry for those who have made the switch to USB C with all their other electronics.

The fingerprint scanner is located a little bit on the high side on the rear of the phone. I have to alter my grip to hit it. It is rather accurate and fast to unlock though. The 7X also has one set of fingerprint gestures that allow you to bring down and up the notification shade. Little features like this that it shares with it’s more expensive Huawei siblings makes this phone feel a bit more expensive than it really is.

Now the Kirin 659 performs nowhere near where I expected it to even when considering this $200 price range. Apps are noticeably slow to load and multi-tasking is near impossible on this phone. This is one of the few phones I’ve used the last couple of years which have fully locked up on me multiple times and forced me to do a hard restart. If you have absolutely nothing running in the background though, the 7X actually has passable performance in comparison with midrangers which is a level above its pay grade.

These mixed results play in with the dual rear cameras too. Like many of the Huawei produced phones, we have a 16 MP f/2.2 sensor accompanied by a 2 MP one that lets you do some neat things with the aperture. Oh and they look like googly eyes popping out of your phone.

The camera and gallery apps are slow to launch a majority of the time. What you see here is already considered fast through my usage. Even clearing up available ram doesn’t seem to speed things up for me. This is a big letdown seeing as the results of the photos are really good. I was extremely impressed with the photo quality the 7X produced. Landscape photos in optimal lighting are sharp and detailed with rather cool true colors. I’m going to have to say this is probably the phone camera in the $100-300 range I’ve used in a couple years. It falls short in low light situations and the selfie camera adds too much processing, but overall this was a reliable camera.

Another thing that was surprisingly reliable was the 3340 mah battery which lasted me for about 14-15 hours a day. I took this 7X and pushed it to it’s limit on my recent trip to Hong Kong and it kept up, at least in the battery life department. Almost 6 Hrs of Screen on Time, which by my standards of usage is very good.

My last couple of notes before I wrap the review up is that the Honor 7X doesn’t have NFC. Most budget devices don’t. I’ve been using Google Pay at ATMs and stores, and ironically in Hong Kong where mobile payments are a huge norm, I brought on the trip the one phone to test that didn’t have access to it.",Negatif
"I really loved this phone for a while until I started having issues. The camera is not that great but I did not expect much from a 200 something phone. It looks and feels like a premium phone despite being cheap on price. When I first got it, it was kind of slow when multitasking. Other than that, it worked fine. After few months, they issued a software update which solved the slowness problem. I could not feel any lag when using normal day to day apps like browsing, Facebook, photos, maps etc. Until that point there were no major issues. Then came another software update after which the gps started having issues. It would not lock on the satellites when using maps . Even when it did occasionally lock, it lost the lock pretty fast. I have had horrible incidents where I tried to go somewhere and the GPS signal got lost and I had to stop the car and reset the phone. I did a factory reset, calibrated the compass, used gps apps to reset the gps but nothing seemed to work. I went to online forums and other people are also having similar problems.

I contacted Huawei and since the phone is under warranty, they issued me a RMA to send it in repair. Now, I have to wait until I get my phone back. They said they do not have a loaner phone that they can provide until mine gets repaired.

So bottom-line, if your phone works, it is a great bargain, but if you have to send it in for repair, prepare to have a backup phone until you get your phone back.

I will update once I get my phone back.

* Update 12/11/18 : the phone came back from repair and they did expedited shipping. Now, the GPS works but it has never worked quite fast and well like iPhone and premium phones from the very beginning. I used an old iPhone 6 plus while this was going through repairs and had gotten used to IOS. After I got this phone back, I realized that this phone is much more slimmer and is overall a better form factor than the iPhone. However, GPS was always spot on, on the iPhone.

* Update 01/29/2018 : I am having same problems with GPS again. Even though the phone was supposedly repaired under warranty. Phone still has few days warranty left so I will try to send it in for repair. I am staying away from Huawei products for sure.",Positif
"Many reviews on this device reassure you that this device is a great device for $200 but the truth is if you forget the price this device is a good device at any price compared to what is out there. You already know the specs so my experience with this phone has been great. I have had alot of smart phones high end and low end this is definitely a mid-range performing phone however for day to day usage like web browsing, watching movies and even playing games it offers a great experience especially if you haven't experienced Android 8 or the 18:9 aspect ratio as yet. The cameras are okay and can produce great photos in good lighting. Low light performance isn't great but I guess it's usable just not impressive. Am not a selfie person but I guess the same can be said for the front cameras they're good but suffers in low lighting. Gaming on this device isn't the best but it's good enough for almost everyone. the only game I play is pubg and it's runs pretty smooth but there are at time noticeable glitches but they don't hinder game play for me at lease. Build quality is great. Sound quality is solid one speaker but it's gets the job done. I have no complains about this phone. Buy it it's good. if you are looking for a flagship you know where to find them but if you are looking at this chances are your looking for something that is affordable and gets the job done this is the most affordable phone you can get that gets the job done. [After 6 months update:] the screen started to have a yellowish tint it seems to occur when the phone is placed under heat. it's 2019 I do not recommend this phone anymore",Positif
"If reviews are important to you, then I'll cut to the chase. I love this phone except for a huge flaw that I want corrected. If you are not into texting, then I give you my 4.5 star blessing. Mazel tov! If you are into texting a lot, keep going as I explain my low rating...

As a person who likes to own her own phone and wants the best quality at an affordable price, I researched this phone for a long time before buying. I don't like to change phones often and I don't like being held hostage at a phone company with high payments for months! So after reading some great reviews on consumer and computer magazine sites, decided to buy the Honor 7x.
Overall, I really like it! I have to take all kinds of pics for work, so the camera function was one of the most important features to consider. It really gives iPhone a run for the money. The sound quality could be better, especially louder, but it isn't poor...could just be a little more powerful. I live in New York, so sometimes in a crowd, I just cannot hear.
Why the low rating then? Because their customer service could not give me an answer to my problem!!!
Situation: I text far more than talk on the phone, so there are two time-consuming and frustrating issues going on.

1. There are several colleagues with whom I group chat using the text app that came on the phone. (They all have iPhones -don't know if that matters). Whenever we get into a dialogue, I go berserk because if I need to scroll backward to catch the beginning of the conversation, then every time one of the others responds back in real time - even if just to ""like"" what someone else said - I can't scroll anymore because the page jumps to the most current comment. So I try scrolling again, then boom! Back to the most current comment. Cant respond if I can't follow! So I just drop out all together until they stop. Then they wonder why I don't answer when they needed my feedback sooner.
2. The second issue is along those lines, but involving all texts. At any time I want to review a previous text with anyone, as I scroll backwards, the page is jerky whenever I lift my finger up to start another downward swipe to scroll. For every five or so comments I pass backwards in a scroll, then it jerks forward three more (i.e., take three steps forward, step back one). It takes forever to scroll. It's never one continuous flow. Definite glitches.

I've had this phone since April, but kept thinking a system update might fix the problem and it never did, so today I decided to contact customer service. We did a text chat on their site. At first the tech guy more or less said it was too bad: it's just how it is....maybe I should try a different app! But I shouldn't have to ask my colleagues to install a different app just so we can have a flowing text chat! I told him it was unacceptable and that I would write a negative review on Amazon. So then he wrote back with some instructions to try involving the cache. I tried it twice and it didn't work. So basically I think the company's response is I'm SOL! To me that is still not an acceptable response for such a large company, even though I know in phone world this is a cheap phone! I had an Amazon Fire Phone previously for which I paid less than this one and I never had this issue!
If Huawei people read this and can come up with a better solution that works, I will be happy to edit this review and give a 5-star rating, because in every other aspect, I'm very happy with this phone, especially given the price. I had literally spent 3 months researching phones and felt like I was making the best investment possible, so to have this type of malfunction going on is a huge disappointment and a huge waste of my time when I'm trying to conduct business.",Negatif
"I would not recommend this phone if you counted on having the ability to move apps to storage (to expand the limited 32gb of RAM for apps with Micro SD sticks). It has been a long time since that functionality was implemented on stock android, but Huawei has not enabled it in their OS. Huge disappointment for me, because otherwise the phone is quite nice.

I would suggest that everyone look at the Mate SE which has more internal memory (64gb) and RAM (3gb) making the lack of functionality less of a problem.",Positif
Very fragile phone. Screen cracked in the second month. I went through 3 glass screen protectors and three cases since getting the phone 14WEEKS ago. I had the previous honor and loved it...infact I'm using that one now since the honor 7 didn't survive a water incident. I'm not particularly rough with my phone. This is the first screen I've ever cracked. Who wants a phone that can't survive daily life?,Negatif
"The phone is light but not too light. Its all aluminum so it feels real tight in our hand. The screen is bright and clear. Its not quite a good as the Samsung AMOLED but still pretty good. It has a small bezel and no stupid ""notch"". Here the best -This phone is FAST, LIGHTENING FAST. It can switch apps quickly, storage is adequate, the OS is simple to use - you will have no problem. It works with AT&T (any GSM carrier) and can take any SD card to expand the memory. I know it doesn't have the cache of Apple of Samsung but it also doesn't have the price tag either - and it does Everything those phones do. It runs the latest Android and gets updates faster than most. It costs $199 and you can have next day or same day if you order early. The best part for me is I own this phone. No payments plans. And there is a warranty. A 100% recommended buy.",Positif
"I love this phone! It's my second $200 phone (the first was the galaxy j7 prime) and this one is miles better. The camera is much better and that was my biggest concern. The screen is really big but it's still easy to use one-handed. The fingerprint scanner is incredibly well placed and works immediately every time. The battery also easily lasts all day and I'm on my phone constantly. Something kind of funny is that the stock keyboard come with what I assume is Chinese emojis and they're hilarious.

I originally came from the galaxy s7 edge and this phone really doesn't feel like that much of a step down for saving $700 dollars. The camera isn't as good but that's a lot of money too pay for a camera. As you can tell, I've been a Samsung girl for a while and switching to an almost stock Android has been great. I always thought I liked the little changes Samsung made but now I think they would just get in the way.

There are a few cons. First is that you need to either put the free case on it or get a screen protector immediately. The corners of the front screen got scratched up after having the phone for less than a day just from setting it face down on tables. Also, Snapchat occasionally runs slow. And finally, I would suggest resetting your phone every so often because it does get bogged down sometimes.",Positif
"This is the third Honor xX I have had. My wife and I each got a 5x, I got the 6x while she was still using the 5x. After a departure to other androud devices in the same price range I'm very happy to be back with the Honor brand. My last phone before this was the Revvl... By far the biggest pos I have ever had, and it cost $40 more then the 7x.

The new phone is thinner, lighter and easier to use one handed. I'm 6'4' and have pretty big hands. My wife at 5'1"" can also single habdes us the phone. I believe it has to do with the new aspect ratio. Seems taller and thinner than the old ones.

Fast, bright and beautiful. Don't think you can do much better at the price.",Positif
"I've had this phone for about 7 months now and I really enjoy it for the money. I previously had an iPhone 6 plus that was just not aging well and needed a new phone but didn't want to pay the premium price. After looking around, I came across this one and took a chance.

I already knew I wanted to switch to Android so that wasn't an issue for me. I work in digital art so having a large screen mattered most and the screen size on this was bigger than my iPhone so that was a big relief. Finger print sensor on the back was much more convenient than on the front and I quickly got used to it. Love that it has expandable storage, a headphone jack, and is very thin and light weight. Not having fast charging or being water resistant isn't that important to me especially at this price point. I haven't had it previously, so I don't miss it. A lot of people are put off with it using micro USB instead of USB type C, but even as a former iPhone user I ended up with more micro USB cables than lightning cables so I'm actually glad I can put all those cables to use and don't have to carry different types when on the go. At the time of this review, most electronics and accessories still use them so it's fine for the time being.

Pictures come out alright but it seems like there is some kind of Instagram filter that makes everything paler and if anything moves slightly there will be a blur. Sound isn't great either and headphones don't make it any better, so audiophiles will be disappointed. My main issue with this phone is that we got the 3/32 version instead of the 4/64 version like other countries get. This phone lags and crashes frequently and I think the extra memory would've helped tremendously. I can fully understand having to cut corners and that there will be things that need to be comprised especially for what this phone costs, but if I know that other countries are getting a better version for roughly the same price then it's not going to get a five star review.

All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase and can't wait for the next model to come out. If you are like me and think that smartphones reached a level of refinement that works for you a few years back, then this is a great purchase.",Positif
"Just got this yesterday and I really like the phone so far. Previously I had an LG G5 but, after less than 18 months, the fingerprint reader stopped working, the power button was iffy, the software seemed to be getting slower, and overall the phone became a paperweight; I couldn't even get it to properly connect to the Honor 7 to do a proper data transfer.

So far, the Honor 7 is worth more than it cost. The power button is separate from the fingerprint reader, and is actually in a good location on the side of the case. The inherent functionality of the OS is great. I can use fingerprint, double-tap, or power button to turn it on; the fingerprint reader doubles as a swiping mechanism to register gestures; the keypads can be changed for one-handed operation; etc.

The OS appears to receive updates fairly quickly from the mainline Android tree; I believe it was less than a week before Android Oreo was made available to users. An added plus, in my eyes, is the inclusion of a standard headphone jack; it's nice being able to use cheaper headphones rather than having to either carry a BT set with me, or buying multiple ones for home/work, with the inherent issue of charging.

The single biggest complaint I have now is the lack of USB-C, but that's only because the G5 had it and I was used to it. Using regular USB Micro isn't horrible, as I have plenty of cables available.",Positif
So far so good. Had this phone for almost 2 weeks and I think it is a good phone. This is an upgrade from Samsung Galaxy S5. I am not a super techy person and am past the point in my life when I was willing to pay big $$ for a flagship phone. I researched phones for awhile and decided to take a chance on the Honor 7X since the predecessor did pretty well. Glad I did. No regrets so far.,Positif
"I absolutely love being able to flex to friends and coworkers that I paid $200 for the same features that they have on their $1k phones. The phone is very stable and smooth, the aesthetics are great. The UI is awesome and clean, at the same time as very customizable. I 11/10 would recommend this phone to anybody and everybody. Huawei should be a AAA brand alongside with Apple and Samsung.

The only cons to this phone that i've noticed after a few months is maybe the picture quality when zooming is a little rough, and the on-board speakers are a big OOF; but honestly are you going to ever use the built in speakers?",Positif
"Great phone for $200. Comes with a clear tpu case as well. Very nice android phone for the price. Just don't expect too much, does have occasional hiccups on some apps.",Positif
"This is the most expensive phone I've ever bought so perhaps take my review with a grain of salt. I absolutely LOVE it. Normally I don't pay more than $50-$100 for a phone, but I can definitely see what I've been missing out on. It's lightning quick and I noticed that people were complaining about the camera, but I think it's excellent and it fascinates me how it can give me a crisp, detailed image upon max zooming in on an object.

I was debating between this and the Mate SE, but I didn't want to pay $50 more for just a 1 GB RAM upgrade. 3 GB RAM is more than enough for what I need. I also bought a 128 GB microSD card to bump up total storage to 160 GB for my music and pictures.

FYI this fits 2 nano-sims and 1 microSD. My carrier is Lycamobile.",Positif
"This phone was great, I bought it four months ago and it worked very nicely except for a couple Bluetooth and lag hiccups. Nothing terrible. Then all of a sudden it started rebooting randomly and now it barely turns on before it reboots. Terrible.",Negatif
Amazing phone for $200 this is my second one had the 5x now 7x is fast I don't need a$500 phone looks great feels great and fast,Positif
"I got the Honor 7x because I really enjoyed the 5x. The first 5 months were great. Then I started getting GPS lost, which while annoying wasn't a total deal breaker. Now (month 8) the phone is completely unusable. The phone will randomly freeze up with any amount of usage and reboot for anywhere from 12 to 45 minutes. And good look trying to get Huawei/Hihonor to honor the warranty.",Negatif
"If you check messages or change tracks from your lock screen ignore this phone. Huawei makes it impossible to expand notifications on the lock screen with their recent updates. Oh, but Android allows apps to create different groups of notifications so that player notifications don't get collapsed with other app notifications right? Nope. Huawei decided to group all app notifications regardless of what app developers specify. Ok, but you can disable non-player notifications so your music/podcast player doesn't get collapsed into them right? Nope, that _is_ an option, but if you disable one notification type on the lock screen, it disables all lock screen notifications for that app, because apparently Huawei just puts out broken software.

Uless Huawei stops breaking Android, I absolutely can't recommend this phone.",Negatif
"I will only ever be in the low end of Android phones, but this really is a good phone, and great for the price. (Prime Day deal!!)
Going from a Moto G3, I really am pleased at how much faster things run on this phone. I actually do like their version of Android.

I'm pleasantly surprised by the camera as well. I would imagine that anyone who's had an iPhone or Pixel would find it to be slow or whatever. But this is just a nice little phone that takes decent pics, and allows me to run several apps without it crashing. I imagine heavy duty gamers and such would probably not enjoy it, I just want to be able to listen to music and have one or two other apps running.",Positif
"(OLD REVIEW NEW ONE BENEATH)I'm ONLY giving this device 3 stars because it's so pretty! The screen is just gorgeous, and on first impressions (just got it in the mail) but man...it won't let me connect to wifi so not sure what to do now. I've been googling stuff for a few hours with no luck. So yeah :/

OKAY SO AN UPDATE: It connected to the wifi like right after this but I wanted to wait a bit before updating this review just in case. ALSO want to add: this baby has amazing standby; I literally leave it on when I leave for work in the morning, and returning at 7pm it still has between 100-98% So yeah...definitely keeping for the moment. Only thing is, when I restart the device sometimes it takes a couple tries before it connects. So yeah.",Positif
This is probably the best phone I have ever owned. Coming from a Samsung Galaxy S5 is like going from a Corolla to a Porshe!,Positif

Great phone for the price. I definitely miss a few thing about my old phone this one doesn't have. Like copy and paste drawer and it connectivity issue to WiFi and Bluetooth. But for $200 but deal out there,Positif
"My wife needed a replacement phone after her Nexus 6P was biting the dust with its abysmal battery life. We got the Honor 7X on Prime Day and also bought screen protectors and a couple cases -- we paid right at $200 for everything. I transferred her data and disabled the minimal bloatware on the phone. It runs like a dream for a $200 phone with little to no lag for everyday usage. She plays Pokemon GO and some other casual games (Catan, Ticket to Ride, etc.) on it and they run butter smooth. The screen is fantastic for the price and colors pop out. Battery is probably the best feature though -- she is able to consistently have quite a bit of battery left by the end of the day after moderate usage (playing Pokemon GO, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.). This phone honestly holds its own against 2018 flagships and is a far better deal. Think of it this way -- for the price of a Galaxy Note 9, you can have 5-6 Honor 7X phones. It blows my mind that you can get this quality of phone for such a low price now.",Positif
"Seriously love this phone! I always lose/break phones, so it didn't make financial sense to keep buying iPhones/Samsungs. So, I tried out the 6x. Once I broke that (because I',m a mess), I upgraded to this one. It is SO MUCH BETTER. It has basically the same functions as an iPhone (face unlock, screen recording, etc.). It is also durable. Like I mentioned, I am a mess, and I've dropped this phone already quite a few times. No breaks! I only have the case that it comes with, and it works so well!",Positif
"This phone is an amazing value! I took my SIM card out of my other phone and placed it in my Honor 7X and it just...worked. Towards the end of my work day, my signal was in and out. I took it to the T-Mobile store and the man there adjusted a couple settings and this phone gets reception and network speed seemingly better than my old T-Mobile device! On top of that, I received two updates for my OS which says they're making sure my phone stays working and up-to-date.
The options and capabilities of the phone are multifold. I haven't really explored half of what it's able to do, but then again, I only do certain things with my phone...but to know I have options available for use in case my needs change, is great.
The phone just worked seamlessly out of the box. My profile transferred and my apps. It was just an easy and non-time-consuming experience.",Positif
"I just began using this phone and the rating might change if I experience any early problems (within the first year of use). Right of the bat I can say it is a good phone at a great price considering its size, features and memory (about 19GB is available for use). It does not contain an insane amount of bloated apps and allows you to uninstall a significant amount, it is unlocked and works with AT&T, it has a very good camera and its very light and thin without feeling cheap. The fingerprint sensor actually works and just recognizes only the finger I registered which is pretty cool. It comes with a plastic case which I will not use as I don’t think it offers proper protection, but curiously does not include headphones which is not a big deal.",Positif
"I have had iphones,top samsung phones, the One plus One, you name it and will never, ever spend that type of money again as this phone is just as good or better for one third (1/3) of the money....OR more... what a joke... NOW if the underwear you are wearing are some fancy label and $300 dollars and that is important to you to have a ridiculously expensive label you can not even see...then go ahead get ripped off.....OR stop being so stupid, stop being a sheep and quit wasting your money and buy this phone.",Positif
"The few minutes I got to spend with this phone before it updated to Oreo seemed promising.
But after updating this phone to Oreo, I had two major deal-breaker issues:

1. The screen dims to different levels depending on what screen you are on: like in apps or even Settings.
--- Other people are having this issue; go search ""honor 7x oreo screen dims"" on Google. Look for the XDA Developers Forum link (should be at the top).
2. Desktop(home screen?) widgets do not automatically update/refresh.
--- Search Google for ""oreo update mega thread honor7x reddit"", navigate to the Reddit page, and use Find on the page to locate ""widgets not updating under Oreo"".
--- You can also read posts about this on the EMUI Facebook page (@HuaweiEMUI).

I don't think these issues are hardware related so maybe these issues will be fixed by Huawei in the future. Your mileage may vary, but be wary before taking the plunge!",Negatif
"Pros:
- Nice feel in a hand (like flagship smartphone)
- battery life (around 6 hours screen on time
- design
- everything works great (expect notifications)

Cons
-notification center is lagging (I hope it will be fixed after updates)
- camera lit bit slow and it look like paint, not photo.
-no fast charging and USB C port

"This is the best phone I've ever had, especially for the price. The high resolution makes it so clear. The fingerprint scanner works flawlessly. Haven't played too much with the camera, but with the two pictures I took, they seemed really good. Not the best picture quality obviously, but still really good considering it's a budget phone. The battery life is really good for me. I use it all day throughout work listening to music and podcasts, as well as get on facebook and such during breaks, and when I come home around 5:30pm, I'll stilll have about 50-60% battery left. Seriously, if you can afford the $200, get this phone. Especially if you use a lot apps. I use a lot of apps for school and social media and for digital books. This phone is great.",Positif
"For the most part this is a nice phone. It looks great, and the fingerprint scanner is really nice and fast. The processor seems snappy so far, but the benchmarks show the GPU is pretty weak. The lack of fast charge and 5g WiFi is a bit of a bummer, but I knew that going in.

What I didn't know was that the wifi speed is incredibly slow if you simply have Bluetooth enabled. Speed tests put it under 5 mb with bt on, and over 60 with it off. I'm not sure if it's just my unit, but the audio via Bluetooth is really bad. Tested across three devices and it just has a distorted sound through this one. Wired earbuds sound just fine though.

All in all, it's a nice, attractive phone for $200, but the poor wifi with bt on, and the audio via bt makes it feel pretty disappointing for my needs.",Positif
"Solid phone for the price. Sometimes I read the reviews and get a little nervous because it seems there are all these problems big and small but I have nothing but a smooth experience. For the price, you get Android 8 which is solid. Phone is fast and smooth with Face ID, touch ID, two cameras on the back that give you AMAZING photos akin to the iPhone X photos my friend takes with his phone. The default applications are surprisingly solid and the best part: if you don't like it because youre on Android you can download a myriad of applications to replace the defaults! I love the default camera and gallery apps because they have amazing features. The feel and build of the phone is incredibly satisfying; I sometimes just enjoy looking at the phone because of how awesome it looks. I like the built in themes option for easily switching to other icon and overlay themes. I haven't had such a fast, sleek, and modern phone for such a cheap price ever: budget phones have finally caught up!
Touch ID and Face ID are incredibly fast and you get 3GB of RAM which means no slow downs or problems. Phone Manager is actually pretty cool and for such a high tech phone, the battery life is phenomenal: rarely do I have to worry about battery life.
I am wholly satisfied with the phone and I think most negative reviews are simply expecting a lot out of the phone. Its amazing for the price and does everything you need and plus some",Positif
"Absolutely in love with this phone. From build material to screen size, speed, picture quality, battery life, it has so much going on for so little price. If all you do is Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and text and call, this phone is freaking perfect. The call quality is excellent, and the texting is a seamless change from my iPhone 6. Although I do miss iMessage a bit. This phone is miles better than that phone though. With this version you get 3GB RAM and 32 storage, or for $50 more you can buy the 4GB 64 storage...but for all I do, this one is perfect. It was $212 after taxes and make sure to check FREE SHIPPING at checkout because this automatically checks a shipping cost of like $10 extra dollars. The phone took about a week to arrive. One negative is the packaging...it was loosely packed in a way too big box. But the phone was flawless. Probably thanks to the metal construction. It also comes with a plastic gell case. The camera quality is OK. def good for the price and better than most. Hardly any bloatware too...so many good things to say so I'm rambling. Just buy it already and you won't go back to the iPhone! I get a lot of compliments on it too asking what it is. It's HUGE and looks like a flagship phone. 5+ stars",Positif
"I bought this Honor 7x to replace my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3 which stopped accepting charges even on new batteries - probably a worn usb port on the phone itself. When the phone arrived I could hardly believe the value for the money (under $190 shipped). The screen is nearly as large and crisp as my Note 4, which was a $950 phone when new. Instead of boring you with a repeat of the impressive specs others have rightly posted on this phone, let me share a sobering fact that punched me in the gut when comparing the numbers against ""flagship"" phones.

Three and a half years ago my Samsung Note 4 was $950 and Samsung no longer supports this (former flagship) phone. Even though it still works flawlessly for me, I will never receive operating system upgrades past Android 6.01. If I were to replace the phone today and amortize the cost over 3.5 years of use, it would come out to about $271 per year of ownership. If my wife's new Honor 7x lasts 2 years and we chuck it in the lake, walk away and buy a new phone, it will amortize to $90 per year of ownership. Another way to look at this is: I'd have to nurse my Note 4 along for over 10 years before the numbers pan out like the Honor 7x - all while enjoying a dated OS and no further factory support from the 2nd year on.

Meanwhile, cell phone CPU's, memory, camera's and screens all improve over time and new OS's make the phones more user friendly than the older ""flagships"" we try to cling to. Well, no more for me. I've seen the light and once I replace my Note 4 I'll cap the replacement at $250 or less with full confidence I'll lose nothing by comparison. As for my new attitude, I say torpedo the flagships and send them to the bottom of the sea. They've gouged me long enough.",Positif
"So I finally upgraded my phone from an Apple iPhone 6 back in July. Man was it NICE to get off that ship. xD I was a little worried about getting a larger phone as I have small hands and women's jeans don't have pockets. LOL
However, it only took a week or so to really get used to it. I carry it either in my back pocket or in a bag/jacket.

The camera looks great as long as you have light, like most cameras. It's definitely an upgrade from what I was using. Has some neat features that are added with the second lens.

The fingerprint sensor is a dream. It's in just the right spot and works great as long as it's clean and your fingers are dry. The one on my iPhone didn't work so not having to type in my password every time I need my phone is extra nice!

Headphone jack is still nice! I use it every so often. Good for planes and road trips.

Battery life is wonderful. Lasts a good 18+ hours with pretty normal to heavy use. I usually can make it last a full day though. I do a lot of social media stuff so I use the camera and post things quite a bit.

The phone runs smooth and I haven't seen any issues with the current OS 8.0.

Definitely worth the price!!",Positif
"Really great phone for the price. I used to have an iphone but switched and I am so glad I did. This phone has a headphone jack, which is really nice because I use that occasionally. But It also has a really nice fingerprint sensor which is super fast, really nice build, loud speakers, decent cameras, and processor and ram that doesn't show any lagging for me. Very glad I bought this phone. Recommend it to all my friends. Only cons that exist because you are spending $800 dollars less: Not superb camera, no imessage because no IOS, and not insane processor and RAM, but I only noticed lagging on my old iphone. I've had the phone for 6 months now, and no aging has been apparent. Still super fast, and still super good battery.",Positif
"I hate being tied into phone contracts so I always prefer to buy a decent cheap phone outright and use it until it dies. I went from an $80 LG G2 mini, which finally broke from too many floor drops during a house move, to this phone. All good so far, a bit too much bloatware I can't easily remove for my liking. I do appreciate that it came with a clear protective case included. It is not too heavy, screen size is great, easy to use. My one major complaint is the battery. I have yet to see 100% charge because it takes forever and I always need to use it eventually which eats away at the battery power so fast. I already have all kinds of power saving features enabled but they do nothing for how long it takes to charge. I am concerned about how it will do in a situation where it may not be possible to charge it often.",Positif
"Man this was a great phone for like 2 days. But we're still sticking with this brand. We bought this brand new from Amazon. Not used to make sure it would be good. After connecting it to Bluetooth it had these lines appear and they just kept getting worse despite don't everything Honor customer care said. Company (phone maker) wanted us to send the phone to them so they could repair it but we're exchanging through Amazon first since we need a phone still. Maybe this one was just bad. Only a few other people online had the same problem. We own the 5, 6, and now the 7 in these phones so they are great. Hold up well. Great pictures and video. Hearing someone who's talking on speaker on their phone is hard to hear on these phones but it's ok. I hope the replacements works and I'll update this review cause I really enjoy these phones. Only 3 star cause phone was amazing until the lines. And both companies are working to fix the issue. So don't Chuck your old phone until you've made sure you won't need an emergency back up for whatever reason.",Positif
"This phone is a great value for money. It has proven to very stable, smooth to operate and has great battery time. The camera is reasonable for the price and every other feature I need in a phone meets or exceeds my expectation. The phone feels and functions like a premium phone. I used this for while, gave it out as present to get the Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked, that has slightly higher ram and more memory. They exactly work and feel the same. I would be happy with either phone, except the increased 64Bit storage that helps with keeping more local files on phone.",Positif
"I searched high and low for an Android operating phone that could do as much as this phone can do under $200, and let me tell you... THERE ARE NONE! This is the best phone I have ever owned, comes with a case which is awesome because I'm still waiting for the one I ordered to come in. I have had this phone for two weeks now and I absolutely love it! I was a little concerned because of some of the one star reviews, but I have not experienced and software issues, and have even dropped it on a hard floor once and it did not crack. The case it comes with isn't amazing, but it certainly offers a light to moderate amount of protection against drops. If anyone else finds a great screen protector for this phone please comment below!",Positif
"Phones have gotten to be so expensive and they are outdated so fast. I have had Samsung Note 3,4, and 5. I decided to try something different cheaper. This phone 7x is great the battery life is amazing going on my second day of heavy useand it's still got life left. For the price you can not beat it the screen looks amazing!

Pros:
Super long battery life
Touch ID is extremely fast with responding
Camera is very good and has a ton of features and in pro mode you can even take long exsposer pictures.
Phone all so comes with a clear case that is actually cool.

Cons:
Speaker is just OK
No Wireless Charging
No NFC
The screen is not as responsive as some of the higher dollar phones.",Positif
"My husband bought this phone for me thinking it would be faster than my last phone. Not only is it slow, but I continually have problems with receiving text messages especially group texts. They just hang up there forever until I go into my settings and put my phone on airplane mode and off for every message that is hung up. This is quite annoying and I hate it. Never had this problem on any other phone I owned. I wonder if it is too late to return it and ask for a refund? It also takes a long time to download long documents and send them. I guess you get what you pay for. Also, have issues with the camera getting hung up and takes awhile to get it set up to take picture, slow, slow, slow.",Negatif
"This is a great phone.

Bought this for my wife to replace her lenovo Moto g4. The screen is amazing. It feel like a premium phone for a very low price. The only issues I've noticed:

the bezel makes the on screen home buttons very close to any case you put on it, making it difficult to hit them without a touch of practice, but very minor.

There can be a slight delay for the same reason above when typing on the keyboard.

Other than that, battery is great, lasts all day. Screen is very nice. Sound is very good. I have a Sony xa1 ultra as well, and the screen size is very comparable, but the honor 7x is much more comfortable to hold, not bulky at all.

If you want a premium handset without a $1000 pricetag, you won't be disappointed.",Positif
"I love this phone!I waited a few months before reviewing and have yet to have any issues. I wish more people knew about it. The camera is amazing,the phone is easy to use and setup, plenty of space with great options to add more, battery life is pretty great and fast to charge, speakers are plenty good. I live in the Midwest in the middle of no where with TMobile and I haven't had any issues not even a moment of slowness.",Positif
"I wanted to wait a while before reviewing this item as its meant to be a long term purchase and i wanted to see how it held up. I'm not the most tech savvy person so this isnt the most professional or technical review for this product.

I love this phone! I had the 6 for quite a while but dropped it into water at a theme park. The 7 was the same price at the time so i figured why not get the newer phone. I am very happy with the quality of this phone and the price. it runs most games very well and handles calls just fine.

Unfortunately, i have to agree with other reviewers that the edges of the touch screen have sensitivity issues. For some reason especially where the ""P"" is located on the keyboard while texting. the problem persists with games. i really have to smash that part of the phone to get it to respond. I've gotten used to it strangely, but its definitely still a problem and anyone buying this item should be aware of it.

If your looking for a low cost alternative to big brand cell phones and your not looking to do anything too fancy with it i think this phone would work great for you so long as your open to getting used to the sensitivity issue with the touch screen. I didnt have that problem with the 6 though, so that is another option.",Positif
"has OTG capability and excellent viewing angles.
it is kept updated with the latest security patch, never happened with my moto g5+.
seems emui is not very patient with third party launchers, won't allow the twin app feature with any of them. i'm using Holo because it meets my needs but fluidity is somewhat lessened.

update 12/31: dropped holo and installed nova for 99¢ on sale and it is running flawlessly.
Jan 12: doesn't feature fast charging but it does charge fast.",Positif
"I've been using this phone from Toronto for about a month and a half now and it has been performing perfectly. It does work with any Canadian carrier on 4G LTE, I am with virgin mobile and it works with 4G LTE. Comes with a clear tpu case, a charger, the phone and a sim tray tool. This is a MAJOR upgrade from my previous phone (Moto G). Camera quality is Excellent in good lighting. Portrait mode isn't that good but it gets the job done. Battery life is good for a whole day and that's coming from a heavy user. finger print sensor is insanely fast. I recommend buying a good case as it is a bit slippery. Call quality is great. Oh and turn off the option where it picks up calls once u raise it to your ear because if you leave it on , it will randomly pick up when in your pocket

Over all amazing, this phone competes with flagship phones for sure",Positif
"I got my phone a day ago, am so in love with it my kids are giving me the wierd look??",Positif
"Technology is getting to the point where having a high-quality phone no longer requires purchasing a $800+ device. Honor device is a perfect example of that. Not only is the phone made very well, but it has handled everything that my wife has thrown out at it, to include playing multiple games, social media, texting, Etc. Francis, he device at this price point will not have everything that the recently released Galaxy (insert model here) phone has, but if you really think about it...How often do you use every feature on the more high price phones? Seriously, I highly recommend this phone, especially if you're looking for a budget-friendly quality device.",Positif
"Not the best but not the worst. definitely good for the money. The camera is less than advertised so that was kinda disappointing. Don't even bother trying to take a low lighting photo. Good outdoor photos though.
The battery is okay. It lasts all day, but if I use it for browsing and such nonstop it eats about 10 to 20% in an hour.
Haven't tried watching videos on it.
The led notification light it worthless, which was also disappointing.
Had there been better reviews at the time I probably would have gone with something else.
The screen quality is good though, it is nice and bright.",Positif
"In October 2018, the price can't be better for a Android Oreo. The phone is fast - much faster than my Blackberry Keyone that costed a fortune.
Everything works great. This device is amazing. Great screen.
I miss USB-C charging and fast charging. Other than that, everything is great.",Positif
"I have waited two weeks before submitting a review, so I could give my honest impressions. I have been extremely impressed with the Huawei Honor 7x. I'm just thankful I had done so much research on different phones in my price range. It is by far the best smartphone I have ever had. I have had LG and Samsungs in the past and they were good phones but I feel like the Honor 7x wins hands down. I protected my screen with Mr. Shield anti glare screen protector and I'm good to go now. Thank you Huawei!!!",Positif
"I'll be short and sweet on this. The device is neither thin nor thick, and its weight is more than fine for someone like me whose wrists and hands can support more than a pound of weight for more than five minutes. For its price the build quality is commendable, and my only gripe is the choice to make the rear dual cameras have their own assemblies rather than being under one piece of raised metal and glass. Dirt and dust gets caught in-between the cameras frequently enough to cause some frustration.

The screen is in some ways better than I expected, with only slight color shifting at odd and infrequent angles. Camera is very good and i've taken some very pleasant pictures with it, and I've only slight dissatisfaction with the kirin processor in here. The single bottom-firing speaker is... alright, i suppose. You really should use headphones with this phone if you like listening to music. Also, the bluetooth reception can be quite shoddy since it doesn't have its own dedicated band, and I've encountered several issues with perfectly fine bluetooth headsets while using this phone.

Overall, not the best phone in its class, but it's hard to with how good budget phones are becoming. I'm happy enough with it to still be using it and still want to use it for a while yet.",Positif
"Penny pinching AT&T prepaid customer here. Purchased a very cheap phone from AT&T recently and determined within a week that the poor choice of buying a 60 dollar not-so-smart phone would have to be remedied. I did some research and narrowed it down to the honor 7x for a number of reasons. 200 dollars is not the easiest thing I've parted with but it wasn't until I had the phone in my hand that the quality put the praise worthy price point into perspective. The ability to trim down and disable alot of the manufacturer pre-loaded apps, dual SIM card capability, definition and clarity of both the display and the camera(s) are astonishing. The battery life is incredible compared to my last phone. I received the phone with 40-50 percent battery life. Discharging the battery via constant video streaming took around 4 and a half hours. The metal housing feels tremendously sturdy and the phone has a weight and presence in your hand that is comfortable. Last but certainly not least, download and upload speeds are ludicrous. I mean, this phone is FAST. 5/5 stars from me. Will absolutely purchase again.",Positif
"This phone is amazing, having been a iOS user for the last few years I came to like the hardware but I wanted the Android operating system. This phone is the best of both worlds, feels exactly like my iPhone. You're getting flagship quality for a fraction of the price, phone is very fast and has an excellent battery. I use mine quite frequently throughout the day and my phone will only be around 50 percent when I charge it before I go to bed. Camera quality can't compete with the top of the line phones but it takes better photos than my old iPhone 6 and I can't complain one bit. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good phone on a budget!",Positif
"I bought this for my gf and she's extremely happy with it,

great battery life!
great camera!
great build quality!!
extremely fast finger print scanner!
its also good for gaming (played pubg for a few hours on it and had no issues )",Positif
Not happy at all. Received first phone...won't send SMS or MMS messages . called company and tech said it's defective and to call Amazon for a replacement. Got replacement phone...... exact same issues can't text. Two phones defective? Doubt it. There is a hardware/software problem with this phone. Maker couldn't figure it out. My cell provider tech couldn't figure it out either. I use it for work and it's been a week and it's affected my business,Negatif
"6 months ago I switched from my Galaxy S7 (which completely shattered within 6 months) To this phone, I saw many people recommending this as a budget phone, I liked the price and no longer see a reason to get a flagship device when all I really do is browse the web, shop online, send messages, light gaming, and use social media, these newer budget phones can handle all that with ease, and this phone really surprised me, all the features built in to this $200 make it feel very premium, it's very fast and responsive, I'd say better than My S7 for a fraction of the price. Flagship devices are really an unnecessary luxury now, as there isn't a need for them as there used to be, this phone really proves that",Positif
"I upgraded my Honor 6X to this new one and im very happy with it, the camera is excellent, the speed is good (it does not stutter at all) screen is huge but some apps are not compatible with this size of screen so you will see a blank space on the bottom..

It feels good on the hand even better than the honor 6x.. I have 0 issues with it and when i got it i installed the clone app (by huawei) and in 10 minutes my new phone was ready to use with all the apps and they configuration i have previously on my honor 6x that was super nice..",Positif

"My last 200$ phone was an absolute piece of trash that couldn't keep more than 1 app in the background at a time and was made of plastic. This was a far different story though. Honors(Huaweis) EMUI software is snappy if a bit heavy on killing background apps. On the other hand, if you have another 30$, I would recommend getting the Mate SE becuase that phone at 230 with 4gb of ram and 64gb of storage is an even greater value.",Positif
"Update: This went from 5 star phone to a 0 star phone for me within the 8 months of owning it. This phone will eventually slow down and stop working. I finally called it quits with this phone when (just now) it factory reset my phone because I inputted my password incorrectly (even though I logged in a couple of times before). It gives you 9 tries to enter it correctly which I did do but then through the day I entered it incorrectly. It should have reset the 9 tries after I entered it correctly but it didn't! Now I lost all my pictures, contacts, etc. I hate HUEWEI!! I'm sticking to Samsung (for android) or Apple phones from now on!! Beware anyone who is tempted by the price. It isn't worth it in the long-run. You've been warned.
_______________________________________________________________
I am soooo impressed with this smartphone. My previous phone (Nexus 5X) bricked on me after a firmware update and I was need of a phone fast!

So I went out looking for the best bang for the bucks but I didn't want to spend more then $250.. I came to the conclusion that whatever phone I buy at that price range will be a used or refurbished one. A little bit of research had me looking into this bad boy and I was truly amazed at the price point. However, I was worried that being a Chinese brand, the quality would suffer (sorry, this myth no longer holds true to me after purchasing this phone and a TCL smart TV).

The final step of deciding to purchase this phone came in comparing what I can get instead for the same price range... Nothing came close after hours of research except the Samsung Galaxy S7.. the difference would be that the Galaxy S7 would cost way more for a brand new phone and a refurbished in most cases would also cost more!!
Verdict after 2 Weeks with the phone: Truly amazing and I'm not exaggerating. I am actually constantly looking at the phone amazed that I got it at this price. It feels like I'm easily holding a phone that retails upwards of $400 but I got it for half that. If anyone else is on the fence like I was.. jump right over! the grass really is greener on the Honor 7X side ( =",Negatif
"I have had this phone for a month and, knock on wood, it's doing great. I like the glass as it's smooth and easy to clean and doesn't cloud up like plastic. Easy to connect to car through blue tooth for hands free driving. Loud and clear sound. Runs movies pretty well also. Charge lasts about 4 days. Make sure you let the charge get down to 15%, when it shows red, before recharging to extend the battery life.",Positif
"This phone is now my daily phone and it definitely is a nice phone. I also purchased a case and screen protector for it and with those I've dropped it several times with no damage at all. This phone is not for those who don't like bigger phones as it is quite large, however it has no problem fitting in my pocket. I have noticed that the ram is a little touchy so you will have to boost it from time to time and not leave open certain apps. This phone charges pretty quick and the battery lasts me all day. the camera quality is nothing amazing however if you are just using it for social media it is fine. The screen looks great and and games look nice. Overall it's a pretty solid phone for the price.",Positif
"Well, it works like what others have said about this phone but my phone kept getting the screen turn off, although, I already set it to 10min. I will only give it 4 stars until I or someone help me solved this issue.

(Update)
Okay, I seem to solve my own problem now with the lock screen time being short. When I do the transfer of data from my google account to my new phone, the backup data was carrying my old phone system into the new phone. In which, the old system info have conflict with the new phone system. After I do a factory reset and not do the transfer of data into the phone it actually solve the problem.",Positif
"I just change from iPhone to android, learning curve is not that big actually. Data transfer take sometime, but worth it. Phone is fast and smooth, battery is pretty good, normal use surely last for a full day.
Price is great for the this phone can do. highly recommend",Positif
"Great phone for the price - got it for my 12 yo as a gift. As a young techie, he can't keep his hands off it (which says a lot about the design and features, especially in comparison that the previous phones that he had and their lack of features that he used to ""hint"" to us about ). It keeps the charge well. We already have experience with the phone so it says something when we decide to buy another one - now his is an upgrade over ours!",Positif
"The phone looks nice and very cheap. But the GPS never work and you will be lost if you are in a busy city driving. The GPS will notify you where to turn left or right after you have missed the route. Sometimes, the GPS does not know where you are, sometimes it does not even start at all. Honestly, the calls are very slow and so many issues with it. I recommend better to get a different phone with higher price.",Negatif
I always but a case and a screen protector instantly for my new phones. The one time I dropped this phone it stopped working properly. The first to go was the side buttons which was the most frustrating. Try having no way of lowering the volume and constantly having to do it manually instead of being able to use the buttons. Apps would always keep shutting down or not functioning properly on this phone. The only good thing about this phone is how well the screen is made.,Negatif
"Excellent value for the price. The phone screen and back are not great materials, but work just fine. Battery life is excellent. Many features are better than what is available for pricier phones: ability to get FM radio and dual sim in particular. Although it took a little doing, I was able to activate my phone at the AT&T store with no problems. I also used a Tracfone ATT sim without issues. I believe that this phone will also work on T-Mobile networks, although I have not tested this. The camera app is not quite as good as my Nexus 5x, but is fine for my needs.",Positif
Love this phone. It is so easy to use and I out the battery to the test the first day I got it using mid level battery saver that already built into the phone. In doing so the battery lasted 36 straight hours at 100% before it died. Way better then my old s6 active that I had. Now you will need a case with this phone because it so slim and light weight. I haven't personally tested the phone durability due to not wanting to break it. But over all an amazing phone for 200 bucks and it easy to clone your old Android phone data over to this phone,Positif
I have always been an iPhone junkie. I would never get anything that wasn’t apple. I recently have been in the process of switching phone companies (because sprint sucks lol) and I didn’t wanna get a new iPhone yet because Apple will release the new ones in November so I bought this phone on prime day to use because it was cheap and I can honestly say that I LOVE it and I’m not sure that I will get a new iPhone when they come out. The only thing I wish was better is the camera.,Positif
"Great smooth fast phone. Camera works like a dream and has a lot of cool features to it. Only problem is that I can't find a way to have the notification details pop up on the lock screen it always says ""content hidden"" and nothing in the settings help",Positif
"This phone is replacing a iPhone 6 and I am astounded at how good this 200$ phone is. The screen display is vivid and the size is perfect for youtube, calls/texting is easy and reliable, camera is quick and responsive, and the fingerprint sensor is faster than my girlfriend's Galaxy s8! This exceeded my expectations for a phone and I don't think I can ever go back to paying more than 500 bucks for a phone. Definitely recommend!",Positif
"I am pretty happy with the quality of the phone. Though if I compare it to my old Note 4, the Note (a phone from 2012) might winout in quality of device. Overall though I'm very happy. One thing this phone beats my old Note 4 on is battery. This thing has a killer battery, ending a day of moderate use at around 70% most of the time.",Positif
"It was coming close to the time I usually start thinking about s new phone because the old one bored me/started having issues. The 7x brings that trend to and end. I love this phone and will use it till it dies.

Overall it's amazing. I can go all day on my phone with moderately high usage. (Mostly texting and Mobil gaming) I have left this phone cased most of the time and always screen protected. No scratches or blemishes on the phone. And best of all it doesn't feel like my phone's battery dies off a little more each day.

My only cons for this phone really is the picture quality. It's eh.. but acceptable. And I wish it had a type c charger.

Screen clarity isnt amazing but it's good for those who are screen snobs.

I love it. You should buy it. And splurg for the 4gb ram phone if you have the extra doe.",Positif
"I'm returning it as soon as my replacement phone gets here. I'm sending it back for the following reasons:
1. The keyboard is annoying. It's a small gripe that I'd be willing to overlook if the phone were otherwise okay.
2. The camera is lackluster. I use my dedicated camera for ""real"" pictures, but this thing really does stink in less than ideal conditions. I use the phone camera to snap quick pictures I can send to family, but I'd rather use my actual camera and go through the hassle of uploading them to my computer and emailing them than to text dark, blurry pictures instantaneously.
3. The phone lags. I wondered what people meant when they said this and thought they were being fussy. After all, it's pretty remarkable to be using a hand-held computer at all. But it does, and it's annoying. I think that my keystrokes haven't registered and all of a sudden, I'm texting like a ham-fingered drunkard.
4. This is main reason. The call quality sucks. The people I'm on the line with come through crystal clear. I come through crystal clear to them, except when I don't. On several occasions on multiple calls, if I literally (and I mean ""literally"" literally, not figuratively) turned my body 45 degrees, my reception was dropped entirely. I could hear the person on the other line, but they couldn't hear me.
I mentioned this to a relative who is a huge tech guy and he had the same problems, but somehow lasted a month before ditching his.
He has a Moto E4 and loves it, but being a tech guy, is already planning on upgrading to a newer version. His girlfriend has had an E4 for over a year and loves it. I ordered an E4 Plus, just for the extra MP on the camera.

If I had problems 1-3 and the call quality/reception was fine, I'd keep it, but since its main function is so fickle, the phone doesn't offer any other redeeming qualities.",Negatif
"This Honor 7x is surprisingly excellent. If you don't need th experience bells and whistles of top of the line smartphones, get this one.
Note: I got this for my daughter to replace her Asus Zenphone II Laser. She loves it so far. It fits her criteria : bigger screen, not too bulky, fingerprint sensor, dual lens camera, headphone jack, pretty color (we got the blue one).",Positif
"We never buy expensive phones, so when we needed to replace our smartphones, I read a lot of reviews. Settled on these for husband and I. So glad we did. We've only had them about 2 weeks, but we're very happy with them. Read other reviews for details. Responsive, clear sound, good picture quality.",Positif
"Had this phone since Prime Day now. Had iPhones since 2011. No way I'm going to pay $800+ for a device these days. Never heard of this brand but took a gamble. I've been pleasantly surprised. Lots of pros and cons to consider if you are coming from an iPhone or you're just curious about this product. Just a side note, there is an option to unlock this phone using your face rather than your fingerprint if you like. It works quite well. I tried to trick it using photographs of myself and it never unlocked. It was quite intelligent.

PROS

-Expandable memory: I love the ability to store all of my photos/videos/music on a separate drive and never having to worry about running out of memory. This feature is like having a credit card without a limit.

-Battery life: I can get up to two days on a full charge. Sometimes I forget when I last charged the device. 30% can last all day. With the iPhone, that meant an hour or two :(

-Huge screen: I never want to go back to the smaller iPhones now!

-Speed: This phone is fast! Apps open quick and the fingerprint sensor recognizes your touch almost instantly.

CONS

-Brightness: Screen could be a bit brighter, especially in broad daylight.

-Bluetooth delay: My biggest gripe. If you have a Bluetooth headset, you will notice a delay in movies or YouTube videos. Read other reviews on here. It's just the way it is. Apparently it's due to the shared wifi and BT antennas. Nothing I have tried can solve the issue (developer settings, factory resets, different headsets). Restarting the phone will work temporarily but eventually the phone will delay again. Huge bummer since iPhones never had this problem. You could run a wired headset but who wants to use those?

-No NFC: This means no Android pay capability :(. I still have to carry my wallet around I guess.

-Camera: Like everyone says, it's pretty bad in the dark. It also takes really blurry pics if you have a shaky hand. There may be more settings I haven't played around with, but in all honesty I've been more impressed with photos from Apple's 8MP phones than ones from this phone that claims to shoot at twice the megapixels. Pics get much worse if you use the zoom.

-No wireless charging. At this price, I can't really call this a con, but rather a missed luxury.

-Vibration: The vibrator is much weaker compared to any other phone I have owned. If I have the phone in my front pocket, I will not even feel the vibration from a text message.

All in all, I only paid $167 shipped on Prime day for this phone. I'd buy it again even at the current price. Hopefully the manufacturer will read these comments and fix the Bluetooth delay and maybe I'll upgrade to the next version. I will wait for the reviews before I buy though!",Positif
"The 2nd sim card slot is only 2G. Telus here in Ontario Canada does not operate on 2g. The main sim card is 2g,3g,4g. Does not work on Telus with dual sim, one sim card only.

UPDATE - phone gets randomly stuck in a constant reboot , turning on and off and gets very hot. I am returning the phone.

I wanted to like the phone but not really being dual sim and the complete unrealibilty due to occasionally turning on and off constantly I have to return it.",Negatif
Excellent phone for an excellent price...,Positif
"I originally had the ZTE blade. However that phone kept on glitching. Yet I still enjoyed the thickness of the phone. So I did my research and looked for phone that was supposedly supposed to be the same equivalent in size. After reading reviews and checking the price range I seen that this phone was ranking High so I decided to give it a go. After having this phone for approximately 6 months there are several things that irritate me. First the phone is not the same thickness as my previous phone it's very slim. Yes I know that's a personal preference not a flaw of the phone in general but if you're looking for a phone that's thick do not allow the stats on the phone too deceive you. Secondly, the phone jack does not work meaning if you want to plug in headphones it doesn't work. If I'm using the Bluetooth feature and try to sync it with another Bluetooth feature and speak the speaker and Bluetooth features on the phone seem to jump in between each other glitching. Also while browsing or going through several apps the screen tents to become non-responsive to touch. Overall this phone has many settings that are somewhat confusing and it does not play well or nice with other devices I don't know if that's because it's a foreign phone or what. But I would not recommend this phone",Negatif
"Phone performes at the price level. It is fairly fast and not laggy but i dont download alot of apps etc. so i dont clog it up much, happy with the performance so far. screen is just o.k. its not amoled but it'll do. my only dissapointment lies with the camerea...its barely decent. my last phone was an asus zen phone 3 zoom and the camera on that phone was top notch so i was a little spoiled. all in all worth 199.00 i guess but my next phone will have a better camera.",Positif
Just got this phone yesterday and my first impression was that the build quality and look & feel of this phone is just amazing for the price. Battery performance seems to be stellar and I did not face any lag while accessing my applications. Touchwood!,Positif
I needed a backup phone and have previously used other brands that were much more expensive. For the money this phone does an exceptionally good job. I was expecting much less and got so much more.,Positif
"Very cheap, very high quality. Nifty fingerprint sensor is far more convenient than normal passwords. The only catch is that the company that makes these phones is famous for spying on it's customers, to the point that the DOD bans the sale of these phones on government property.

Of course, I'm sure Google does more spying than whatever it is the chinese manufacturer does (after all, it is in china that google is testing all of the latest and greatest consumer spying, censoring, and manipulation methods), but if privacy is a concern, don't buy this phone.

Other than that, very great phone for very cheap.",Positif
"Love this phone. I will never buy a 1000 dollar phone again and get locked into 2 year contracts. Screen resolution is beautiful. It takes high quality pictures which makes it stand out from other phones in this price range. looks, feel and acts like a much more expensive phone. Was super easy to set up on my AT&T account. Set up in seconds.",Positif
"Great phone, extremely happy with it. Snappy performance for a ""so called"" budget phone that is borderline flagship quality.

Camera takes amazing picture.

Build quality is superb. It has some weight to it, you actually know when you are holding it in your hand.

Compared to previous phones I have had in the past, this is the best one by far (Note 2, OnePlus One, Moto X Pure, Zenphone 3 Max).

This phone still has a headphone jack, which nowadays is considered a premium feature IMHO. The sound quality from listening with headphones is amazing.

The lack of NFC shouldn't steer you away since NFC payments aren't status quo yet.

Definitely getting the most bang for my buck. Bought a second one for my Daughter",Positif
"I have ordered this phone and it is arrived on time. Before this, I have order Moto 4, but that phone was heating up after and not to easy to hold. Honor 7X is one of the best phone without any heating issue. Features are good, Camera is wonderful for average use. Very good processor for playing games. Overall the product is good.",Positif
"This phone is generally a good phone. If I never took pictures I'd love it, especially for the price. However, I am a mom and my main use of my phone is taking pictures of my kid (at least it feels that way! Haha). I've definitely noticed a huge difference in the quality of photos compared to my last phone, a Nexus 5x. I plan to find another phone with a better camera and pass this one to my husband who uses his phone mainly to play games.",Positif
"I am loving this phone, I did months and months of research on what phone to get and I started at the s9+, for the dual cameras but eventually I found this, a great phablet with dual cameras that blow the doors off 500$ flagships. In the end what got me hooked was the amazing battery life, big screen and dual cameras. And honestly, you can't go wrong for a phone of this price (especially when upgrading from a galaxy s4)",Positif
"This is a decent phone for less than a fortune. Sound quality is fairly good; photo/camera quality could stand to improve which was surprising to me.

I also miss having the option to set specific ringtones AND text sounds to each contact like with the Samsung Galaxy; but no biggie.

I'll update once I've had the thing longer than 4 hours",Positif
"It's the best phone you can get for $200. The aluminum build is awesome but if your going to get the blue one because you think it looks good I would reconsider the black color. The blue isn't bad and my friends are always asking me about it but I think the black would have been a good too. The camera is actually really good if your patient with your shot, none of these photos are edited in any way because I know some people will try to make that point. I come from an iPhone 6s plus so I definitely recommend this if you want an Android device that can do just about anything you ask it to do.",Positif
"So far so good. It's not water resistant and I know the Moto G6 is supposed to be better, but for the prime day price of 169, I had to go with this. It even came with a clear case! If its' still running in 1 year, I'll bump this to a 5. If it doesn't, I'll drop it to a 3.",Positif
"I'm from the USA and am currently going through family mobile. I have no issues with my service. Setting it up was a pain but that was on family mobile'side. If you are already a family mobile user than I would recommend purchasing a byop Sim card online while you wait for the phone to be delivered as they are $1 compared to the $55 you are forced to purchase in the store (comes with one month of service but still charging you $25 for the sim) other than that, I absolutely love this phone and will be purchasing another for my fiance.",Positif
"Excellent, excellent phone for the price. I have friends who are locked into contracts who tell me they wish they weren't because this phone has changed their mind about unlocked GSM phones. If you use Straight Talk like I do, this is a great phone to have. Highly recommended.",Positif
"Bought this phone cause I had the older honor and enjoyed it and liked the upgrade on the speed and picture quality on this phone and came with a U.S. warranty. Got the phone loved the look and the beautiful pictures only down side was when you zoomed to far it got blocky but not a bad deal for a 200.00 dollar phone. The issue was after 2 weeks the phone started having issues not receiving texts or calls, then screen started fading and wifi as well as my 4LTE stopped working. Got no help from the customer service no replacement even tho it was warrantied. So I had to spend another 200 dollars with in two weeks for a new phone. Very let down on honor.",Positif
"Wow, what a decent phone for 200 monies.
Picture? CRYSTAL

Performance? SUPERCAR

Storage? EXPANDABLE BABY! but decent.

Camera? NOT AT NIGHT! Also decent though.

Battery? AVERAGE AT BEST! but not terrible.

Sound? WHO NEEDS GOOD SPEAKERS? The 7x apparently.

But I am a happy boy with a shiny toy.",Positif
I have dropped twice today. No scratch or dent on the steal body. Screen still looks brand new. Phone is mostly water proof except phone speaker. Don't submerge it on purpose. great for people who sweat and ruin their phones. This phone is just as good as Samsung and iPhone. I've had both. I feel ripped off by both companies. Buy this phone you will not regret it !!!,Positif
"Very satisfied so far, have had for a couple of weeks now & can't believe how good this phone is! Don't think I'll ever go back to paying those outrageous prices for another brand again. Went to Best buy & was browsing when a worker there told me he had this brand & loved it, I'll pass it along!",Positif
"So far I have used this phone for two weeks straight, the battery holds up good from a full charge in the morning 5am to 2pm without charging and at full performance. Have upgraded the software to Android 8 and it still runs smoothly, I had one hiccup when I just got it but not since the update. The camera is great with great quality detail. Each shot is captured nicely. I can do plenty with this phone if the internet works with me, split screen and various other functions that I am discovering everyday.",Positif
"Pros:
From the software features, of which there are many (go look up videos of things you can do with this phone!), to the beautiful screen, and the lightning fast fingerprint scanner, this phone is the best bang for your buck on the market. It's durable, I've dropped it and had no issues, the aluminium back was scratched, but not very much, and that's to be expected.

Cons:
Low light environments do not fare well with the phone's camera, however at this price point you can only get so much camera wise. There isn't as much RAM as one would like, the processing power isn't particularly incredible, and not having USB-C is a bit annoying, but once again, you can only get so much at this price point.

Overall: I will tentatively say that it is currently the best phone on the market for $200 or less.",Positif
"I bought this phone in March of 2018. I haven't even owned it a year. The battery is swelling and it's disfigured the whole phone. The screen is slowly popping out and there's discoloration on the screen from the pressure. Apparently this is an early warning sign that the battery's getting ready to explode. The battery cannot be removed or replaced on this phone, of course, so the whole phone is now useless. The cause of this is a battery with cheap, sub-standard materials in it. And that's apparently what this phone uses. Buyer beware.",Negatif
"I’ve just returned from a trip to Europe and Africa and used the phone as my travel phone. It worked as advertised and I am glad I got it. I’ve owned an iPhone for several years and my experience with this phone and android was pretty good. Highly recommend it especially for the price, quality, and functionality.",Positif
"This was one of the best phones I've gotten myself in the recent years, so good in fact someone thought they have it, not me. I am a college student and its ability for dual application use and its super fast speed really saved me (and my GPA) more than once. I would recommend this for anyone who needs top of the line but is also on a budget. The only thing I would warn people with is to keep it close to you, and always check your pockets. I plan to order a new one in the near future.",Positif
Honor phones are not just hype. Got this for my Mom to replace her samsung S7 and she is very happy with the switch. Great larger screen battery life is way better and she can still use her old 128gb memory card. And its running andriod 8 oreo such a great deal.,Positif
"One of my favorite phones I have ever owned... at a fraction of the price. Very well built. Fast. Great screen. Very good (not fantastic) camera.
Updated to Oreo without issues. I miss the lack of NFC. I miss USB C. But WOW! I will definitely buy the next version of this phone. Warning for smaller hands: it is 3 inches wide. You may not find that very handy....",Positif
"I previously had an old android phone that served my purpose.
I felt it was ready to die on me so my Grandson who is 15
did some research and felt this would be a good phone for me.
I absolutely love it!! Did not know what I was missing. It has good
reviews and I am glad I took my Grandsons advise. Easy to use
and if beautiful. Lots of tutorials on YouTube if you need some
help figuring things out and lots of tips and shortcuts.. Awesome phone.",Positif
"I don't know how to start my review on this. Because im so happy after receiving this phone. It's so stunning and cool and really easy to use. The battery backup is going well than other android device I used before. 100% of charging easily goes long for whole day. Even i used it heavily gps, music and apps. Its a well valued phone and amazon.com delivery is amazing always on time. And i want to advice the packing department of Amazon warehouse please use some bubble wrap or plastic bags with the product. Don't throw the only item in the box. I know you guys worried about your rates but please think about customers item not to be damaged in that way. Rate only 4star because of packing not well done...",Positif
Got the phone. Surprising me a lot. Only 200 dollars. But works axcelant for me. Texting is good. Searching Google is good. Everything is good enough for me. That is all the review for those 5 days I use.,Positif
"The phone looks great and is easy to navigate, but everything is super glitchy. I've not yet had it for a year and there are a ton of issues. It won't scroll up when I'm trying to see back in a text, you can't archive texts, no visual voicemail works, my GPS is failing/not accurate... I could go on and on. Not sure why this is happening. About to start looking for a new phone.",Positif
"I've had this phone for about 8 months at this point. Overall I'm pretty happy and it works well. I'm quite disappointed with the camera specifically. It performs poorly in moderate to low light (smudgy, pastel-looking pictures) and I have essentially stopped taking pictures of my 18 month old child with it, whereas my prior phone (Google Nexus 5x) performed without complaint in the same scenarios. Pictures look okay outdoors or in well lit areas. But for a budget phone or a bridge to tide you over if you don't want to splurge on a nicer model for another couple years, this one will work pretty well overall.",Positif
"I am normally an LG person, but this phone really took me. I was surprised with the amount of available settings and customisation of the phone. Phone calls are great, SMS works well, 4G datab no complaints here and definitely the best phone I've had yet.",Positif
Mine freezes from time to time but I run alot of big apps at the same time and I understand this is a budget phone. It looks and feels good and is very well built and its features always work. The camera is brings up alot of red but besides that it's amazing.,Positif
Great phone for 200 bucks l. Anyone who says it sucks cause they cracked it is a wast of time. I cracked mine because i was being ignorent so buy a case. So far i love this phone i had an HTC one M8. This phone is good for gameing and almost never lags . It's comparable to the phone 7s and the Samsung Galaxy S8,Positif
"Good:
-18:9 ratio
-Screen (good viewing angle, resolution, size)
-Built quality
-Looks (have gotten compliment)
-Enough storage and RAM
-Battery life (tend to use it in battery saving mode and lasts me the day and sometimes more)

Bad:
-Perhaps the EMUI skin
-Bought the phone with the intention of unlocking bootloader but they stopped providing key (disappointed but not enough to detract from phone's overall quality)

Average:
-Speakers
-micro-USB",Positif
"I was skeptical, as always. I wanted an iPhone but couldn't afford it. I thought this was going to be a phone wthat would give me problems or something else. But this phone is amazing, fast, sharp, the picture quality when watching things and playing movies is amazing . I highly recommend this phone , you will not regret it.",Positif
"Phone runs smooth so far. The only downside is the single antenna making it near impossible to use bluetooth and wifi at the same time. I did have a pretty frustrating experience when I first turned it on and connected it to wifi. After about 5 minutes it kicked me off, and everytime I tried to reconnect to wifi, it showed ""Denied access to network"". I tried forgetting and reconnecting, power cycling the phone and router, and making sure there weren't any MAC filters preventing connection. I finally resolved the issue by updating the phone's software which took 8 hours of using purely data. Since the update went through, the wifi is working perfectly.",Positif
"The device is working well. I choose to stay with this brand of cellphones since my last Honor ( 6x) worked so well. I had the 6X for 3 years and only towards the end did it start giving me a little trouble (flickering of the screen.). I bought the Honor 7X hoping that this new device works as well for me and most importantly, it last a few years. Can't wait for the Honor 8X",Positif
"Decent phone for the price, but don't expect it to work like a Samsung flagship phone.
Pros: Nice big screen, screen brightness works well in Bright Florida Sunlight.
Cons: Slow response occasionally, you can feel the lag after pressing a key. Even crashing sometimes ending in restarting the phone.",Positif
"I bought this phone in mid July and it's probably been the best phone I've ever had! After 4 months it doesn't look like it's showing any signs of wear or slowing down! The picture quality on the back camera is amazing, but the front camera definitely has some room for improvement... The only other problem I can think of is that I can't seem to transfer apps from the device to my SD card, but it isn't too much trouble since the phone has a pot of space on it.",Positif
"Fantastically camera, good battery life, good gaming graphics, fast and accurate fingerprint scanner. Huawei did it again with this phone: My wife has the 6x that was current when purchased and has also had a fantastic experience, I would expect as much from the 8x that has since been released.",Positif
I was coming from a OnePlus 3T which is already a couple years old now. So I thought this device would be at least as fast as the 3T if not faster. But it was really slow performance wise. Another problem was the amount of time it took to charge since it does not come with fast charging. I believe there would be much better phones around the $300 mark. Returned the device after using it for a month.,Positif
I have used a different brand for the last 12+ years. Changing carriers so decided to change phone brands - I could not be happier. A colleague had one and really likes it. Bought mine and two others I know also bought them. A great phone for a great price,Positif
Im very happy with this phone. It keeps up with constant use and maintains a strong battery after not putting a full charge for days on end. I wish there was a more manual option for picture taking but it still takes some great photos.,Positif
"I have the Honor 7x for a couple months and I like it. It has all features that much more expense ones have (dual camera, dual sim, finger/face recognition login, etc). Unlike my old phone, there are no finger prints on the screen so it always looks clean. The reason I only give it 3 stars is because panorama photos are blurring under low light. I can only take sharp panorama photos under bright day light. Anyone has this issue?",Positif
"Up until now I have been a Motorola fan (Have had two versions of the Moto X), but when my last one broke, I needed to spend a bit less money. This phone is great! It is faster than my Moto (bigger RAM). The camera is not quite as high of quality, but it's not the end of the world. It's still really good compared to a lot of other ""cheaper"" smartphones (my husband's cheaper phone's camera is much lower quality).",Positif
"I love that it has soo many apps so no worries about downloading them. Soo much to do on here, never a dull moment with this phone",Positif
"I love this phone, functions just as good as an iPhone or Samsung. Will be buying family members one in a few weeks as gifts.",Positif
"It was a really nice quality feeling phone. I thought it ran pretty good and had a good camera, for only $200, but after a day or 2 inoticed that I wasn't getting any services for the first 15 minutes of my commute.
I do live somewhat out in the country. I haven't changed cell phone providers, and I have always gotten service with my other phones in that area,so all I can figure out is that it's the phone. My husband would have service while we were driving together, and I wouldn't have any at all. My phone would say"" no mobile service available"". I wish this phone would get better recent, because it is a nice phone.",Positif
"What a great phone! Low price should not put you off. This phone compares perfectly to any other. Has all the bells and whistles. I'm still finding new things to enjoy! Amazon does it again! Buy it, you won't regret it!",Positif
"i've been using this phone for bout 3 days n my experience so far is great. as stated in the other reviews, the performance is great; battery life is more lasting than i expected, fingerprint detection is fast, n the performance is just simply amazing as it doesnt lag that much. plus, the phone looks rlly pretty, so thts a heads up! the only concern i had when ordering was, if the camera quality was going to be nice or not. when it came n i tried it out, its actually pretty good. the camera quality is not as gud as the iPhone x , but i can work with it. overall, the phone was a steal for its price n im satisfied with this purchase.",Positif
"I did my research, looking at phone from various manufacturers and at different price points. My Wife has used this phone since Friday Oct. 3rd, she has given me her honest opinion, she loves the seamless interaction with the phone, word of advice, if you buy this phone do the system update 1st, then update the apps you want on your phone.
I would recommend this phone.",Positif
I love this phone knowing it's pack with features that I need (app twin...app lock....safe...) This is my 3rd honor device and won't be the last 5star all the way better than my s7 edge where security and privacy is concerned,Positif
"I bought this phone after a lot of searching because I had a tight budget. I don't regret buying it all! It's been less than a month that I have been using it and it has no lags, the battery life is great (I use google maps a lot and I can still use my phone for a whole day without charging it!). The picture quality is average. The phone comes with a cover instead of earphones and I found that made more sense for me! Would recommend to anyone who needs a phone under $200",Positif
Never Buy the latest and greatest. This exceeded my expectations by 10x. Destroyed my basic Samsung Jxx performance wise. I was shocked at the speed of this with large apps (Home Depot). Save $600 over a marginally faster flag ship phone. Large screen requires bigger hands.,Positif
The battery started giving trouble within 6 months. Its keeps cutting off but saying battery empty before and then coming on with battery at a higher percent.,Negatif
"Overall, great phone. I bought for less than 200$ and for that price it is a great purchase. I would recommend this phone.

Pros:
-Good design, sleek look and appealing
- Good camera performance in good light, with a lot of control in pro photo mode
- Very good battery life
- Solid processing and multitasking
- Large display with nice color

Cons:
- Screen glare in the sunlight. Honestly, this is quite annoying since the screen is not nearly as clear while in the sun light.",Positif
This phone is for my tech savvy husband. It has all the bells and whistles of the newer Android phones you can buy with none of the bloatware. The phone is expandable by adding an internal memory card that you can't beat. He is very happy with his phone and we are now a Huawei family! Delivered fast and on time.,Positif
"Great device - so far has service in the rural midwest, boston, california, Cost Rica, Mexico - will test Thailand next week.",Positif
"Highly recommended
Update: I'm facing many system problems recently!! No one is answering me from the customer service!!",Negatif
"Sad sad...but the screen shatters...and took me a day to find one in Singapore. Still not arrived owned for 3 months!
Not user friendly...touch the contacts screen and its ringing! Try to end a call and one is opening and closing everything to switch off..Only a small green band on the top which does not open ...my calls often are 20 seconds longer! Camera hopeless...cannot change the picture size! Alarm is hard to set...and has let me down 3x! Sad as I say but maybe off to a bad start.",Negatif
"Looks great. Case is a nice little extra. Has issues with some notifications, even after poring through and properly setting up the whitelist. Lag issues went away after updating to latest version of Android.",Positif
"Well for the price it's really solid. The only complaint I have is the fingerprint scanner works like 4/10 times I scan my finger. It kinda sucks nuts but doesn't degrade the phone much. Camera is really solid, software is up to date, and it's just snappy in general. If you're looking for a high end phone this cheap, this is the closest you can come.",Positif
For the money I think you would be hard pressed to find a better phone with more features than this. I bought this for my 13 year old son and he loves it. Does everything you would expect a modern smart phone to do at an affordable price.....highly recommend!!,Positif
A pretty great phone the battery life is great and the screen texture is smooth I have dropped this phone a few times and with the clear case you get with it not a single dent not a single scratch its just a great phone all around,Positif
"I had a couple other competitors. This is the best phone I've owned. Took a trip to India, wanted a good camera, best camera on a phone I've ever used. Got some amazing shots.

Phone's now updated Android 8. Perfection would be 64gb or 128, but with a microsd card this is a great phone",Positif
For the price the specs is too good to be true I bought this for my friend I was amazed by what this phone can do for the price it is it almost has the same specs as my Note 8 the camera is great the user interface is great for the price yeah.,Positif
"Great phone for the price. I've used the Honor 5x and this is a nice upgrade wile being basically the same price. It's quick, responsive with decent battery life. Honestly, the only thing that would put people off is the UI but it's not difficult to get used to.",Positif
"This phone has been behaving very good, temps are reasonable(even though i have a big case), battery lasts me about 19-25 hrs depends on the use ( i always have apps running in background).
just in case you want to know Works fine with AT&T and Cricket.

overall feels premium.

looks 9/10
screen and colors 8/10
camera 7/10
battery 9/10
temps 9/10 without case, 8/10 with case

Update: 5 months with the phone and still 5 stars",Positif
This phone is good for the price. Screen touch needs to be improved. Only allows a single press at a time. Sound is OK not great. Network and WiFi connection is not the greatest. Don't rely on VoIP type calls because of the constant reconnection.,Positif
"The Honor 7X surpasses all expectations I had when purchasing. The phone is sturdy, has an amazing battery (I've had it last 2 days on single charge with regular use), the camera is far better than I expected, and it has plenty of space plus expandable by micro SD. My only complaint with this phone is that it has mircro USB instead of type-C so there is no quick charge and in fact the phone takes a little over 2 hours to charge. Even still this phone has been one of the best phones I've owned and I prefer even to some flagships.",Positif
"I bought the7X in March 2018. My first smart phone. So far no mechanical problems. The phone is well worth the money and I am overall satisfied with it. However, I find the manual information quite incomplete.

When I ""dial"" a 10-digit telephone #(USA), it connects; but some numbers require additional numbers/letters/password in order to route your call to the complete the call.
Does anyone know how to do this? I could not find anything about this in the user's manual.
RIchard",Positif
For now on I will not pay $1000.00 for another phone. This phone has proven to me that you can have a great phone for less.,Positif
This is great. I think just as good as my wife's new Samsung 7S. Only thing I noticed is that it doesn't have 5G wifi.,Positif
Really loved this phone 5 star,Positif
"I love it. Does everything as advertised if not better and It didn't take 30 months to pay for it or require financing. Beautiful screen resolution, long batter life, and it was easy to transfer data from my old phone to this new one with an app.",Positif
"Excellent mid range phone for the great price.

It's well built, and has solid feeling no less than that of Mate 9 that I currently own. Only negatives that I can think of are the lack of NFC, slight more lags for switching applications (when compared with Mate 9), and narrower screen dimension that is relatively new to android devices.

It supports LTE FDD band 17 (and several other bands), so it should work with AT&T, and NVMO using AT&T network like cricket mobile that I use.

I feel that smart phones are quickly commoditized, and it's getting very hard to justify paying for the price the flagship phones ask these days. So this phone is a godsend for me.",Positif
"Based on reviews, I expected a good phone. At first it was, once I did a factory reset. Camera is okay, good considering the price range. The phone itself, not so much. Apps don't work properly, seems like they aren't compatible with software. In fact, apps that I had transferred from my old phone that were working fine were incompatible with the honor 7x, affecting the whole operation of this phone. So right after the initial setup I had to do a factory reset, upsetting but the phone was good to go. Then the problems started. Slow. Laggy. Freezing. Shutting down randomly. Kept having to restart which was very frustrating, couldn't even use the phone for a half hour sometimes.

I honestly don't understand the rave reviews about the honor 7x! I am not a gamer or a heavy user. Calls, texts, light user of social media and camera - that's it. And this phone could not even handle that!",Negatif
"This phone is quick with loading apps, the Selfie camera is awesome, the other cameras take OK photos, with the panoramic picture mode making best use of those cameras. The build quality is study, it has fallen quite a few times, no scratches or broken screen. There is a wide array of cases that keep the phone sleek even with the case on.
For its price, this phone is a worthy buy.",Positif
A great smartphone!,Positif
Love the phone! I'm typing this review on the phone right now. I was not sure if I should upgrade this from the s6 edge I had the international 64gb version. This phone is a lot better because my s6vwas getting old. The case that comes with the phone ruins the look and makes it look really cheap. Ranyi makes a great case for this phone that is 9.99 and I highly recommend it as it makes the whole phone look absolutely amazing.,Positif
"I absolutely love this phone!!!! I have had a many phones in my past, but this one is the best of them all.. Camera quality is great pictures and videos are crystal clear professional looking quality. Phone is super fast no lag and has tons of memory storage. It's been about 2 months since I have had the phone and have had no issues with it what so ever... I would definitely recommend this phone!!",Positif
Looks great works better than expected but it can't access the cell service I use at&t or FreedomPop or others I checked will keep it for sort of tablet. Also hope to travel out of country.,Positif
"Great phone, so my experience with phones has been around the budget area since I previously owned a Asus Zenphone 2 and a Samsung galaxy mini. So what you want to know are the Cons of the phone since everyone else has already explained all the Pros. However one thing that did shock me was how good the fingerprint reader was 10/10 so fast. So onto Cons.

Cons- VIBRATION SUCKS, like damn this motor is weak af, good thing the sound is loud enough
Lot of bloat with the phone
Camera is fine not great not bad
Heavy skin of Emui but its not too in your face
(Micro usb is maybe a con for some but I have a ton of old cables so its nice not having to buy new ones)

Overall my second $200 dollar phone and compared to the zenphone out of the box, its not anything to blow your mind performance wise but right away it feels and looks SO much more premium alike something that would cost $500 bucks. If your looking into this phone right now I definitely recommend getting it if your budget is similar to mine or if you need a cheap phone. Oh and i'm on T-mobile and it seems to work fine.",Positif
"this phone is excellent, it's beyond for how much i paid. Great feeling holding it and having, love the design, the way it holds the software and everything basically. The camera is good but not the best, but it's fine for how much i paid. Best budget phone out there.

HERE'S AN UNBOXING VIDEO OF THE PHONE:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLlSUMlkkxo",Positif
"This is a great phone for the price. Big screen, decent battery life. No real documentation on how to use, but my kids gave me a thorough tutorial.",Positif
"Best money I have ever spent on a phone. My girlfriend is jealous now because she's still paying on her iphone, and this does pretty much everything it does for waaayyy cheaper.",Positif
"Amazing out of the box but with major flaws. The camera is great, though slow to load. The screen is beautiful and gigantic. I really wanted to love this phone but it's major flaw is with the simplest features. Apparently they used one antenna for both bluetooth and wifi so neither works well and even worse when they are both being used. I expected to give up some features with a price point at 200 but the amount of issues I've had connecting bluetooth devices is absurd. I've paired and re-paired my garmin watch more times than I can count. Not having my work truck recognize my phone basically makes this phone useless to me. Some days it finds my bluetooth speakers some days it can't. Great phone as long as you don't plan on using bluetooth.",Negatif
The best phone ever built on a budget. Don't waste money on flagships until you try this phone.,Positif
"First why border spend 1000 on a phone.
this 200 dollar phone almost do the same .
I can said you dont feel a big different .
I have.iphone 7 plus. dont feel big different.
only.the price....

i vote 4 because can not change battery.
I like the big screen.
and phone run smoothly with game.
long battery.",Positif
A good inexpensive phone. It's a pity you have to choose between the second Sim and a memory card but for me the 32gig storage is fine so I use the 2 Sim cards. It has its quirks like any other phone but so far they have been minor. I like it.,Positif
"I bought this phone and it has so many good functions! first of all you can use fingerprint to unlock or you can choose to have face unlock. it comes with the latest security patches and updates, not hard to use and it's camera is a top-notch camera with so many good functions as slow-mo, a great bokeh effect and much more. the Honor team did a great job here and people like it so much, i bought 2 more for my friends.",Positif
"The sent me the wrong color phone! But whatever! Excellent phone! Runs smooth. Fantastic photos. Runs games, apps and emulators smoothly. Lots of storage space.
Call quality leaves something to be desired, in terms of volume and carity but it's far from awful. Phones speaker is not going to WOW you but it's servicable. This is a budget phone after all. OS has no guest mode. Battery life is not as great as most phones and charging is slow.
Phone looks and feels wonderful. Sharp wide pictures look great.",Positif
"I bought this unlocked phone because I saw It on straight talks list of compatible phones. IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE. Now I have to return the phone, case and protection plan! Very disappointed...",Positif
"For the price there are few cellphones with the amount of features this phone has, the screen is particularly nice as it covers much of the phone, on the back it looks like an Ipod, that may be a good or bad thing depending on the person, it has a real dual camera setup that's good, but not great as there are plenty phones that take better pictures but this one cost a fraction of those

In summary this is a great phone specially considering the price and features it has, there is more good than bad

Pros:
* The Screen with the new Screen Ratio so popular in flagship phones
* The Price
* There is a clear rubber case included in the Phone
* The software has alot of options and it feels quick
* Dual Cameras are good but not flagship good
* Good Battery Life
* Metal Body
Cons
* No NFC
* 5 Ghz Wifi
* No Fast Charging",Positif
"Pretty good, haven't had it long. Pictures are decent but not the best. Good value for the price compared to other smartphones.",Positif
For the price you get more than ur money worth. I got this for the frequency to work with one of my carriers. It's even better than I expected it can't reach to my LG G6 but I will keep this one,Positif
"I bought this phone for my brother and he doesn't wanted to spent too much money so I was looking for something in our budget. I am very glad that I took right decision to buy this phone; solid material, easy to hold, great picture quality, video conference quality is perfect (duo, WhatsApp, fb messenger). The phone satisfies customer from all aspect.",Positif
I honor phones there nice and make it through a day and love the big 6in screen great for games or YouTube plenty of storage and it’s a great plus if your in a budget this is for u,Positif
"The Honor 7 does most things well. Two problems: I experience significant lag time in response if I forget to swipe apps closed after use. Just keep the RAM clear and things seem to respond well. Also, there are dropouts in the signal when I use the Bluetooth connection to my car's stereo, more dropouts than usual with this car and my old phone. Also, if you want near field communication, this phone doesn't have it. Battery life is great.",Positif
"**Edit**
Recommend going through Honor chat support to get ticket if needed (don't leave message on unattended chat - won't be answered). Turns out hotspot issue was operator error - I used a hotspot name my computer ""remembered"" so it wouldn't prompt for a password. Once I renamed it, it was fine. However if it had been the phone other than clearing cache, it would have required a reset - or maybe repair.

I think phone on ""automatic"" makes some pictures outside a little bright and tinny feeling right out of the box. That feels a little unfortunate. I'll update after I have tested more. At least this phone offers some basic settings to play with. The portrait mode doesn't always give me the bokeh effect. Again, more testing needed. I wasn't expecting professional but for novice was hoping for a little better point and shoot good results.

**Original**
So far, putting it through it's paces, I'm really happy. But I'm stepping up from $100 phones, with the last one still being on Android 5.5, so any comparison is relative. I had a great experience with Ting, including a free sim card when I asked them some presale questions, and the phone activated without any issues.

A clear flexible case for the back does come with it which was a bonus. The blue is a pretty color, wouldn't want to cover it up. Missed having gorilla glass from my Moto G a couple years back. So, pleased it is one of the phone features. Overall it's not too bulky for its size, retains the earbud plugin port, has a nice clear display, seems responsive and I liked the pictures I've taken so far. Nice options all the way around in this Android version 8.0 Oreo. Fast charging seems to work as expected with the included cord. Fingerprint scanner works great. Calls were clear both ways.

Have had a few glitches worth mentioning:
- does not support wifi calling (Ting does, so it's the phone)
- when I set it up as a hotspot, even though I created password and the icon on other devices saw it as locked - they were not challenged with a password request (have sent a message to support, so we'll see). workaround is to manually allow devices.

I'll come back and edit if I have any further problems, or get an answer to the hotspot issue.",Positif
"Very good phone, purchased it for using it as a daily carry, has good battery life, the screen looks nice, software is runs smooth and although of course it does not have the best camera in the world it is still very usable, overall a very solid and practical phone specially for its price tag.",Positif
I loved the Honor 6X and only upgraded to the 7X because it was cheaper to buy this one than the 6X with an Amazon deal and at first I thought the screen was almost too big for comfort but once I got a good case that had a ring buckle on it for support that wasn’t an issue anymore. Still better than an iPhone.,Positif
The best budget phone of 2018. Fingerprint sensor is stellar and works perfect except when hands are wet. Does a great job in sunlight and the battery life is the best I've experienced so far.,Positif
"I bought this phone after apple slowed their phones, I had an iphone before and when I looked for phones, I found this phone to be a perfect match for iphone S. My niece had previously bought this phone and she loves it so I decided to give it a try. Very nice camera, good size.... and the speed it loads is amazing. Absolutely worth it!",Positif
After trying apple and windows phone I have found this phone. I love it! It does everything I need but at a fraction of the price of an apple phone.,Positif
"It seemed like a pretty decent phone in the first day. Day two, the fingerprint scanner just stopped working. I've returned it before anything else breaks .",Negatif
"Huge screen and very responsive fingerprint reader! I don't miss the exclusion of 5GHz WiFi or USB-C, because I don't have a compatible router or any USB-C cables or other devices anyways. For $200, there is no better value. Some people dislike EMUI, but I find it quite nice. Coming from a Moto G3, I do miss the motion-based gestures, but not worth docking any stars for.",Positif
"This phone is really good for the price. When you look at a phone around this price range you don't expect much but honor gives you a lot more. This phone feels like its $600-$700 just on build quality. The photos are hit and miss. Night photos are terrible. During the day you can get some really good pictures! The sound is what you expect from a $200 phone. It's best you use headohones. All over if your new Android or need a budget phone, this is the one!",Positif
"This phone isn't a bad phone at all compared to the price. Latest software, fast, and sharp. Front camera quality can be better but you are able to customize the picture appearance to make it look great",Positif
"I am very happy with this phone overall.
One thing to keep in mind, if you are a Snapchat fiend - the app will periodically freeze up really bad on this phone to the point where the phone has to be restarted, if you keep it running - so i recommend closing the app out every time after you use it.",Positif
Best budget phone ever,Positif
Best phone I've ever had! I'm 74 years old and found it very easy to use. It has everything I need and more. Especially love the long charge!!! No regrets!,Positif
"Good camera, screen is bright, fast ,no complain but why only 2G on the second Sim.",Positif
"Amazing value, just doesn't work on Verizon networks",Positif
"This smartphone meets my needs. It is economical to purchase, takes good photos, and plays clear sound. I couldn't be happier!",Positif
2nd one I have owned. Battery lasts for 5 days with location turned off. 2 days with location turned on. Better than any other android phone I have owned (Motorola and Samsung).,Positif
I honestly don't have a con for this. The camera on this phone is great. Pic quality is sweet. Sound is also great. Easy to set up. I have family mobile/T-Mobile and it works great.,Positif
"Great phone, great value. Metal case and build quality is top notch, great hardware specs, super fast, great camera, awesome price, can't think of anything to complain about.",Positif
"after using the phone for more than 2 months, I found that everytime I change the themes, the new themes messed up my contact list, it just wiped out all phone numbers eventhough the name of all contacts still there but numbers were all gone, I had to re-loaded them again from my back up and then deleted all the duplicates that was sooooo frustrated, that forced me not to change my themes again because it was absolutely horrible to have to fix your contact list especially if you have a long list...another thing is once in a while the phone was not responding at all even right after reset, imagine youre doing something important and all of the sudden the phone stop working that need to reset again all your works are gone, it was such a big waste of time. will never purchase Huewei/honor again, don't buy this product it's not worth your time and $.",Negatif
"Easy set up, intuitive. Useful features: you can set up schedule for the display to minimize ""blue light"" effect, and brightness can auto- adjust. Easy on the eyes, and lots of text- adjustments for reading. Pleasantly surprised by this phone.",Positif
"It's cheap and good but the only place it lacks is on the camera, pictures come good just that colors look weird sometimes depending on the light.",Positif
"Great phone. Fast, beautiful, functional. Really good mid tier phone for entry level price. Nice big screen, fingerprint sensor, extra storage. Good buy. Forget the name brand and save $$$ on a comparable product.",Positif
"This phone is really good. Battery is amazing, 3300 mia lasts over a day. The camera is not the greatest but still pretty decent. The processor is also really good. For the price, this phone is a bargain.",Positif
Works and looks great. Just what I expected.,Positif
I switched from Apple and I will never look back. The 7x works great day in and day out. after letting a few people see what it could do it blew them away that it was priced at $200.,Positif
"honors are the s*** best phones out there in my opinion, seriously better than any iphone",Positif
"This is truly a great phone, I love everything about it so far and have no complaints!",Positif
"Item just as described, plus more un-mentioned useful features - such as a Mirror app and Speech to Text messaging feature - among my favorite, most useful features. Room for improvement - No suggestions are shown when entering recipients for new messages. But on a whole, overwhelming 5 stars.",Positif
"I really love it.

Pros
It's fast,
Gorgouse screen
Long battery life. It lasts me the entire day

Cons
Does not have a picture stabilizer",Positif
I really loved this phone for the first few weeks but it has gradually become more and more of a pain. It is slow/jerky at times and I have to restart it multiple times a day in order to get it to work for a few hours. Would not purchase again.,Negatif
I must have looked at mid-priced phones for 6 months and wasn't really happy with any until I found this one. I'm convinced that this is the deal at least of the decade!,Positif
"I like everything about this phone. I've had it for awhile now. I've been converted from Samsung, this phone is superior in every way compared to my like priced Samsung phones.",Positif
"Very happy with product, so far. Nice looking, comfortable to hold. It is a bit heavy but that was expected. Can't comment on anything technical since I'm not a techie. Was just looking for something a little larger with nice features.",Positif
"Usually get top of the line phones. Got rid of my LG v30 after getting this phone. The battery life is amazing, lasts over 2 days.",Positif
Really wonderful phone. I upgraded from the Honor 5x and am really pleased with both phones. One thing I've noticed about the Honor phones is that they are pretty durable. The user interface is also intuitive and easy to set up. The camera is exceptionally good. The professional mode works well and I can even take long-exposure twilight shots. Overall very pleased with these phones.,Positif
"Very responsive, camera quality is ok and has a very responsive finger print unlock. very good for the cost",Positif
"the best option I could take when selecting this phone. i'm from Venezuelan and use Movistar and this phone it works perfectly in 4G LTE Bands (1700/2100).

The screen resolution is excellent, the camera resolution is very great, take a good picture.

this phone arrive with Android Nougat but instantly you can update to Andoid Oreo.

really really recomended",Positif
This phone is huge! It takes the best pictures I have ever seen. A million times better than my Samsung A billion times better than the iPhone.,Positif
"Bought this for my wife as a replacement to her Nexus LG 5. She enjoys it very much. Food screen response, looks sharp and has a great battery life.",Positif
"this phone i thought at first was new and amazing but it immediately started messing up.. the service wouldnt pick up as good as my phone before in the same areas. it would drop calls, speaker messed up and eventually screen wore out. i only had phone 2 and half months.",Negatif
"Flagship Killer, plain and simple!",Positif
Very good value for money. Has the lastest features and is 4 times faster than iphone,Positif
"it works great, it is for an older people, which is more than enough. camera takes great pictures but too many apps that come with the phone which take a bite out of the memory.",Positif
"Been using it as my main phone, work great. Have the Android 8 via EMUI. That provides some cool features such as screen recording with out external app and nice gestures for use. The camera is great to capture nice pictures and provides some filters and extras for long exposure photos.",Positif
"I value reviews on products I intend to purchase. Typically, I don't do reviews but I felt obligated to do so on this phone. I consider myself to be tech savvy but not a tech snob when it comes to phones. That being said, I know what I'm looking for in a phone and I thought this phone had it. I had been patiently waiting on the Honor View 10 to come out (guess I should've waited a tad bit longer) but decided to bite the bullet and just buy this phone until its release.

THE GOOD:
Beautiful phone- solid build. Love the aluminum body and how it feels in the hand. Love the skins and themes you can download to customize the phone. Transferring all of my apps / accounts / etc from my previous phone was a breeze and only took about an hour or so.

THE BAD:
I'm coming from a ZTE Axon Mini 7 which has given me hell with performance issues. Watch Netflix on the Axon 7 Mini is a lot crisper than this phone (sure it has something to do with LCD vs AMOLED).

THE UGLY:
RAM RAM RAM! Imagine my heartbreak when this phone started to lag not even a week after owning it. Imagine my frustration when I realized there was a Mate SE model with more RAM that was available for $30 more.

Needless to say I am in the process of returning the Honor 7X and purchasing the Mate SE. Totally worth the money in my opinion.",Positif
Excellent phone. As close to iPhone as Android can get. Best of both worlds together. Love the finger print id to unlock. Also screen is nice and large and it's very fast,Positif
This phone is an excellent budget buy. Only difference I've noticed between this and $700 competors is the Bluetooth isn't as reliable but still functions good enough.,Positif
I purchase this phone last month for my husband after reading customers reviews and I must say my husband is really enjoying this phone. He love taking photos and the quality is really nice. The screen size is amazing. Overall he is really pleased with my purchase.,Positif
Its camera can take very good pictures. The calling and SMS function works very well. The sound quality is not bad. A very good choice for a $150 Android phone.,Positif
"The GPS chip is malfunctioning apparently Honor 7x company made a bad deal by installing cheap and bad quality GPS unit in to this phone... An advice :if you using google or other maps application frequently, This is not the phone to buy, it won't be long time before you get disappointed...",Negatif
"I am in love with this phone. You won't regret getting this phone. The camera is amazing takes clear sharp photos and the speaking plays loud and clear. Additionally, the apps open fast and flawless have not experienced any lag while using my phone. The appearance of the phone is crisp and it is so lightweight. The display is also very clean and bright. I am very pleased with this phone and if you choose to purchase it you would be too.",Positif
Great phone for the price. I've been using it for a few months and love it. No bugs or issues.,Positif
I wish it had type C and a fast charger... I think the Honor 8 was a better version. The camera and other apps react very buggy sometimes,Positif
I bought this phone less than a month ago and it has some issues. First week was great then it started freezing having 2-3 apps open. Now for no reason the screen will go black for no reason. Not worth the money.,Negatif
Such an amazing deal. It's a very good phone at this price. Highly recommend.,Positif
An issue is that the face unlock is a little off and sometimes takes too long. Another more important issue is that the phone sometimes becomes really slow and unresponsive for about five minutes and then returns to normal,Positif
"I absolutely love this phone! Great interface, easy to use and navigate. Great storage options. Basically, premium quality without premium price, a definite superb buy.",Positif
This phone is so mush better for the this price. It is fast and has most of the features compared to all the high end $1000 phones.,Positif
Bought it to replace my honor 5X Huawei is really stepping its Smartphone game up Watchout Samsung and Apple,Positif
"This phone is amazing. The battery lasts all day. I used to have an S7 edge and after 6 hours of normal use I would be down to 15% what's amazing about this phone is that after 6 hours of the same use, Instagram spotify, messaging i went from 83% to just 70% Phone is extremely responsive. Great buy.",Positif
"Just got it a few ago and I'm really liking it; the only bad thing about it is the font camera ?????? 8mg, type disappointing. That aside, completely worth it. Hopefully the 8x comes soon; that's definitely worth $200",Positif
"Works well, but you get what you pay for.... The sound is not great, touch response is not the best.
Battery life is very good",Positif
Good phone does anything you need (have not gamed on it though). Unfortunately a week or so after i got it a pixel died on the lower half of the screen; i don't mind it too much but it is something you should take into consideration.,Positif
I had the honor 6x and I believe that performed better than the 7x. Notifications don't come through consistently and now I have data deadzone areas even though it is the same sim card. I miss my 6x,Positif
"My only beef with this product is that they removed the capability to move apps and such to an SD card, at 32 gb you are kinda limited once you've downloaded music and such, everything esle is A+ tho",Positif
"I've had the phone for around 4 months now and it is a great phone for the price! Of course the camera is not as good as like a super expensive phone, but it takes decent enough photos. The speakers are very good and there are so many features that are customizable so you can really make the device your own. I definitely believe that this is a quality phone.",Positif
The camera takes awhile to focus. And the speaker is okay kinda quiet. Browsing the internet and watching videos are great the screen is a nice size and the picture looks great. It comes with a clear case cause the phone is really sleek and slippery by itself. Has a good battery life. I thinks it's one of the better budget phones available.,Positif
"Likes- premium look and feel, 18:9 screen ratio, fast fingerprint scanner and facial recognition, good battery life, great price.
Dislikes- lousy mono speaker, micro USB port, no NFC, unable to move apps to SD card.",Positif
"I love this phone, nice and big.",Positif
"Great Cellphone, more than i expected",Positif
for the price hard to beat,Positif
"I liked the phone design and it worked fine for about a week of light use. Then the first sign of trouble appeared - screen flashing purple streaks that would not stop until reboot. Invalid MMI code error appeared although there was no connection problem initially.
A few days later screen froze and unit would not boot up.. After factory reset the phone worked for a day and then froze again. From that point on the phone got stuck in boot up screen with no ability to even turn it off. Factory reset stopped working, clearing cache had no effect. HiSuite software was no help since phone settings had to be adjusted every time it was connected via USB, otherwise HiSuite would not detect the phone, even though Windows had no problem seeing it and accessing files on the phone.
Call to Huawei tech support, although pleasant enough, provided no solution other than offer of shipping the phone for repair.
It may be that I was just unlucky and the unit I received was defective, but since I consider reliability to be the most important feature of the cell phone I have to mark it as completely unsatisfactory.",Negatif
"Simple, not expensive, very functional. I removed a bunch of the installed Huawei apps to clean things up. Liked this phone that I ordered for my husband so much that I bought a second for myself!",Positif
"I have really enjoyed my phone thus far. The quality is very good, and easy to navigate. Similar to Samsung which I like because I don't like the iphone setup. Holds the charge for a long time and recharges quickly. The size is decent, large screen. If you have small hands like me it can be difficult to handle sometimes with one hand. 5 stars overall!",Positif
I cant write a full review on the phone because I just received it today but I will caution against buying the amazon recommended case for the phone. There was a case included with the phone that is almost exactly the same. Save yourself $12.,Positif
It's great phone for the price! I live the way it feels in my had and it runs fairly smooth too. I use the GPS on this almost everyday and it works great and very accurate. The real only down sides to this phone is the camera and the speaker isn't very loud. But I've owned it for 2 months or so and I am very happy with my purchase.,Positif
"Best phone I've ever used, very impressive for the price.",Positif
Great phone for the money. Quality build and a beautiful screen. Don't pass this one up.,Positif
"Watch out, the volume is VERY VERY LOW. Otherwise, great budget phone!",Positif
"Very good phone,with very good parameters,no lag at all,and it offers the functions that other even high class phones doesn't offer totally worths it.Also it will soon get EMUI 8.0 update,so it will add even more features.",Positif
This phone does everything that I could possibly want a phone to do.,Positif
"The AT&T website was having a problem, and complained about the IMEI, but everything is working well after I went to the AT&T Store. Fantastic phone! This phone feels like a phone costing several times more.",Positif
Like any phone it has its issuse but for $200 this is an incredible deal ...This phone premiered with $800 features and worked like a $600 phone.....the Oreo update gave this phone even more value,Positif
I thought this was awesome ..bought this after reading so many good reviews. Don't know if this is a defective items but the phone shuts down and restarts constantly. Reset it to factory condition twice but no luck. Returning this phone.,Negatif
Great budget phone and look awesome,Positif
Exactly what I wanted and I'm in love with it perfect phone for me as a teenager going through school.,Positif
For the price I haven't seen a better phone.,Positif
This phone is far better in quality than it's actual price. The benchmarks are good and the camera is far better than the majority of android phones. Coming from an apple user this product is a great alternative.,Positif
"This phone goes all day, great kids phone if you are not on a CDMA carrier and you want something cheap for the kids. Dont believe in putting out $1000 to what equates to an MP3 player or a kids toy.",Positif
"So far all has worked perfectly but price dropped 10%in three weeks, how about a 20 dollar refund to my account.",Positif
I love this phone so much. I just got it and for the price it works amazing. If you're doubting which color to buy just get the blue!!! It's so beautiful. Looks better than most brand new smartphones.,Positif
Fast processor and good storage. Dependable solid phone. This company makes phones for bigger name brands.,Positif
A+,Positif
"So far, there is nothing I don't like about this phone.",Positif
"I don't usually review but the phone is great for a budget phone, it even has some features that some more expensive phones have! It takes nanosim so be cautious if you have an older phone. All I wish is that it could've came with the Oreo update and some headphones, but besides that it really seems worth it!

Update: Works with MetroPCS, just purchased a nano-sim and everything works great so far.",Positif
I am an honor fan. This one is great so far. However the audio is not that great.,Positif
I bought this over the thanksgiving weekend and took it on a vacation with me to India. However this phone didn’t have a voice over lte support which it claims to have.,Positif
Bought this for my 10 years nephew and he loves it,Positif
"The best phone I've ever had for $200, absolutely no complaints.",Positif
"Big screen, amazing battery life, speedy response and good signal. I'm really liking the phone. Only complain is the speaker could be louder, water resistant and wish it used USB c but that's just me nit-picking and was resolved with an adapter for a magnetic charger",Positif
I love this phone. smooth gaming experience and unique look.,Positif
"Item is working very good, I think is very good option in category smartphone under 200. recommended",Positif
"Perfect phone, there really isn't much to say. Honor phones are seriously the best these days. Especially for this price.
The one and only issue I have with it is that sometimes, when I'm writing, my touch doesn't register and I end up missing letters.",Positif
I love the phone it's my second one.. All though I did by a case they recommend a slight fall from waist high cracked the screen.. case or no case don't drop it.,Positif
You should defiantly buy this if it's your first phone. It comes with an available transparent case. It also has long lasting battery holder with is a super deal package. It's a great deal. My friend and I were searching for a phone for me. I though it would be a risky thing but it wasn't. It's a super great deal. Trust me It's worth it.,Positif
The sound is very bad!! Before i had an moto G4 and i thought this cell is better but not... I put the max volume and i can hear the external sounds... Don't buy if the music is important for You... I regret...,Positif
Android 8.0 Oreo! I cannot stress enough how thrilled I am that a sub $200 phone has a newer version of Android than most high end phones! This phone is fast and the screen looks great! Really happy with my purchase.,Positif
"My favorite phone so far. Just a picture quality is a little weak, phone service drops in certain places, lags hardcore if you don't manage your apps.",Positif
"It's not as fast as my Nexus 5x was, however considering the price it is a OK phone.
My favorite part is the camera which unfortunately once in a while freezes.
My least favorite part is that it doesn't come with a USB type C.",Positif
I fricken love this phone. If this breaks I'm just getting another or the updated version. ?????? I would recommend this 100 percent.,Positif
What an upgrade over my last phone. Does everything I need and more. Great screen. Good camera. Great quality at a decent price.,Positif

Got on prime deal sometimes it acts slow but it works great,Positif
"Great phone, great value... couldn't be happier.",Positif
"It is a great a phone with features that I find useful for every day use. I recommend it since it's a budget phone that is advanced in the quality it holds. It doesn't heat up. The GPS works. The camera is good and on top of that, it doesn't crash but may rarely lag. Overall, it qualifies to be one of the best budget phones around.",Positif
Great phone and great price. The only reason I didn’t give it 5atara was because it does not have wi-if calling which would be great for where I live.,Positif
"Pros
Storage space
Phone speed
Pretty

Awesome camera ..lots of storage and great pix,Positif

"After constantly buying crappy metro phones. I had enough and wanted a better phone that'd last me a while. I saw this phone while looking at the Sony Xperia. Phone looked beautiful but the bezel was too big. Then I saw the honor 7x. I drooled at the features this thing had. I watched videos. Read reviews. Even purposely looked at why you shouldn't buy it the reason weren't enough to make me not want to buy. It came 2-3 days than expected and the box itself looks extremely sexy. The way they have the tape at the bottom so you'll know of someone was in it. Then when it came to opening the box it came off like butter and seeing the phone was an instant nut. It was smooth, had a nice weight, and screen. Mmmamamia it was sleek. When turning it on the UI was amazing. It had an iPhone and Android mix. Forget team Android or iPhone, phone had both. Settings it up was a breeze. Downloading apps. Easy. Then I went to settings to turn on all the cool features. I went straight to looking for the option to expand the screen on any app. I tell you what, with this option my phone looks like any iPhone someone would have. You keep the back of the phone down and nobody would know the difference. This phone is more than awesome especially for only $200. All I have to say is to not download too many apps. It will take up all the Ram and it will start to slow down.",Positif
"Amazing phone. I bought it about 5 months ago, and so far, I haven't had any problem. I have always preferred Android over IOS",Positif
My experience is iPhone->Nexus->Honor. Honor is doubt the best!,Positif
"Best $200 I've ever spent. Camera is good, memory is good, no lag, large screen, good sound quality, great battery life, fast finger print scanner, dual SIM,....etc. Love the overall look and feel of this phone. ??",Positif
This phone is outstanding. The front camera is slow and bad quality but the build is amazing. Same size as iPhone 8+. Fingerprint is fast and simple. 9/10,Positif
"This phone has 32gig memory and 8 processors. It was taking forever to download all the bloatware. I could see that much of this space would be consumed by trash I dint want. I tried to watch video, amazon video to be exact on this phone. Dispite it having a supposedly good screen resoplution, superior to my current Blu phone it was horribly fuzzy. I dont know why. Back in the box it went. The very medioiocre battery life was another factor. When the time comes I'll just get another Blu phone with a good sized battery since I know this is a big factor for me. If the battery runs out it wont matter what the resolution is or how many processors the phone has, it wont work.",Negatif
Outperforms a mappple miphone 7 and a quarter of the cost,Positif
"I’m happy with this purchase as described the phone , i use it in North Africa the phone is compatible with all wireless companies ,completely unlocked .",Positif

"Love this phone so far. The display is big but not ""too big"". My husband loved it so much, he got one!",Positif
The volume level should be improved but overall I really like the phone,Positif
"This is a fine phone for the price. My old Samsung finally died after 3 1/2 years. This is a feature rich phone. The colors are vibrant and the AI is awesome for the price of this phone. About battery life. I use my phone for calling and texting and google calendar and photos. I charged phone day I had chip installed (T-Mobile). My battery had 19% left after seven days, so I find the battery life more than adequate.
The phone is very fast and was easy to hook back into T-mobile. First phone call automatically went to T mobile. Gave them my old chip # and new chip #, they sent me verification code on my email, read it back to them and I was good to go. It did come with a clear case cover included. I am very satisfied with the purchase.",Positif
"It's the second one I order. I like the phone alot but like the 2nd one is lags and the options ""wait or close app"" pop up often aside from that it present an issue with Instagram stories and I can't find a solution but the first phone did that as well get back to me with possible solutions??",Negatif

I wish it had more screen protector options available.",Positif
"My S5 recently broke and I was looking for a good-quality phone within my budget. For $200, I couldn't find a better deal on a new phone. I really love my 7X because it handles beautifully and offers great specs for half the price of other brands.",Positif
Great phone for the prize,Positif
"This was my first smartphone and I was very impressed. It can do everything I need efficiently, loads my apps quickly and gets me where I need to be perfectly. I was never going to spend 1000 dollars on a phone and this is an excellent choice for a phone at a practical price.",Positif

"Ive been using this phone for months now, and for the prices there isnt much to complain about. The picture quality is fine enough to get the job done. At times the phone lags when running more than one heavy usage app such as snapchat or pokemon go.",Positif
"Wow ... This is a great phone for the price, I am verry happy with it ,the us global version has exceeded my expectations I have what feels like a flag ship phone . For 219 $. I recommend this and will be buying one for my wife .",Positif

Good buy.,Positif
??,Positif
Bought mine on Black Friday for $123. I honestly didn't expect the smooth processing ability this budget phone possesses. It's literally a cheap device with flagship capabilities. ??% satisfaction ??,Positif
Hell Ya I really really love this phone am so happy have used it for a month and I would buy a second one any day of the week. I would even buy this as a gift. I just wish the blue was cheaper when i got my phone I would of loved the blue one but i can live with sexy black,Positif
"I am very disappointed and regret buying this phone. I purchased this phone in February 2018 and now the phone won't charge. Also, GPS does not work. It is not acceptable that this phone lasted less than a year.",Negatif
"I got a new phone but it was super slow. I replaced another one.
The new one is also slow in camera...",Negatif
"Well I was happy with this phone, I love the camera and the things it does. But my finger ID touch sensor just went out this last week and that really bums me out, I haven't even had the phone 5 months. So that changes of my satisfaction for sure.",Positif
It's one of the best mid range phone the only thing I ordered blue and I received a black,Positif
This phone is a very good phone but when using the slow motion in videos it should have better quality,Positif
I love the phone there just one thing when you play pubg it's really leggy but the rest of the games have no problems at all,Positif
Good value for a cheaper price. Picture and sound quality is not good. Otherwise it is fine.,Positif
Great budget phone.,Positif

"Slow, sloooooowww, sssllloooooowwwwww POS. Locks up, backs up ucks up.",Negatif
"Best budget phone out there no doubt, impossible to tell it's 200$",Positif
"Once again the Chinese have done an incredible job of giving flagship phone build quality with upper tier internal components as well as high end features like dual cameras all for 200 dollars. I ended up giving the my 6X to the misses as she really needed an upgrade while I'll preordered this 7X. They improved on the screen size as well as improving build quality and material feel. The slight curve towards the lateral edges of the device give it a pseudo S8 kind of feel in the hand. Side buttons have a good feel and click like a top notch device. The also went with protruding lenses in the back like Apple, possibly do to light restriction on the previous model when a case was used. Huawei also makes it super easy to put everything from your old phone to your new phone with their clone app that even a smart phone novice could do in less than ten minutes. Good job on making the best budget phone out there Huawei. You've got a lifelong American customer here.",Positif
"At first it was great. An ideal phone for the price. The camera was buggy as hell and took forever to start, but installing a 3rd party app fixed it. Then it would occasionally freeze and hang, but I didn't mind too much. After all, it was $200. THEN this morning, it died with no reason. It worked last night, and this morning I wake up to a dead phone. Just like that. No warning, nothing. There's no smell, the charger works, the cable is fine, it's just dead. Yesterday I got a popup from one of the pre-installed apps saying I could use it to contact their customer support if I ever needed it. I hadn't seen that. How suspicious that it died within 24 hours of that message. How does a phone die right at the 2 month mark? Baloney. This was my second Huawei phone and the other one wasn't great (the battery lasts less than 8 hours only a year after purchase), but was a real budget phone. I won't be getting any more of their junk if this is how it works.",Negatif
item as describe,Positif
"I bought this phone on July to replace my wife's old phone. However my wife did not use it right away, and when she started using it, the battery was bad. It cannot charge. The return window is closed and the product service is also closed.",Negatif
Still getting used to android after using apple product for years so I have some frustrations that having nothing to do with the phone. Image is good and performance is very adequate. Well worth the price.,Positif

My phone blanked off.. how do i find out about warranty. Please email me,Positif
Great phone. Loving it so far.,Positif
"I drop it all the time and it looks great. Not a fan of not being able to use the phone at all if the camera is covered, but other than that it is a great phone.",Positif
"cheap, works fine but i have to use the phone without the case because for some reason the gps doesnt work with a case on. i assume the signal is being blocked with a case",Positif
This is great little phone. It's very sleek and beautiful. It's not the fastest phone all the time but the battery life is amazing. I can 2 days without having to charhe. It's honestly amazing for that reason.,Positif
Great phone... The only complaint is the phone does not have WiFi calling .... It would have been good if Amazon would add this special in the description. All in all it's a great phone and great connection on metro PCS,Positif
"Love it. Works great, great camera, good storage, cheap price",Positif
good quality,Positif
Reliable,Positif
Now my wife wants one and I'm ordering it right now,Positif

"Comes with a free jelly like case, couldn't get a better phone for the price point. Just beware, the screen is very easy to crack, so try to avoid dropping the phone on it's corners.",Positif

This smartphone gives you a bang for your buck. Excellent! I'm thinking of buying another.,Positif
good,Positif
This phone is a great value. It came with a case which I wish I realized because I purchased another case. The case that came with it was a better quality!,Positif
"This is a truly unlocked phone. I love it. I got rid of an iPhone for a Samsung Galaxy. It was a good move. Now I got rid of the Galaxy S5 for this Honor 7x. I don't need a cleaner app, or an anti-virus app, or a launcher (because I didn't like the forced home screen, etc) - because these types of apps or functionality come standard in the phone. I can set the grid size of the screens, set how the screens transition, etc.; all the functionality I wanted in Nova Launcher. The response time is fast. The fingerprint access is faster than the Samsung. This is certainly a ""flagship killer"". I use it with Straight Talk and it works just fine. Even switching my number to the new sim (I was already on ST) was quick and painless to do myself online in my account. I would definitely recommend this phone to my friends and family.",Positif
Grate phone,Positif
"I love it! It tells you how much ram you're using, it's fast, it looks great, love the big screen! Overall great! The storage isn't great but its WELL worth the price. Love it!!",Positif

"It's really a good phone for the given price. It feels and looks like of really good quality material but under pressure the phone might slow down. Also, the speakers are a bit tiny but otherwise it's a really good phone.",Positif
The sound could use some work and the placement of the speakers is bothersome but it's a really good phone with pleanty of features.,Positif
Honor 8 was great. So bought this phone. The camera always crashes. Phone is laggy and almost usable. I am an Android device pro and really know how to use an Android device. This is a very poor followup of Honor8 Device.,Negatif
"I purchased this phone for my daughter as an upgrade from her previous honor 5x, and she loves it. Great phone!",Positif
"Only had it a few days.
Thus far, seems to be a really nice phone for the price.
Nice camera too.
Only complaint so far is that Huawei's proprietary Android build prevents you from installing apps onto the SD card.
(which is easily done on most other android builds.)
Its internal memory of 32GB ships half-full with just theOS and the apps that cannot be removed.
And yes i have set the SD as the default storage location. But the apps still get loaded onto the internal memory and cannot conveniently be moved.",Positif
Still have it. I slammed my car trunk on it but did not crack. But bent a little.,Positif
Very good,Positif
Great phone for only $200,Positif
Easy to set up...doesn't feel cheap...it is unlocked...very smooth,Positif

My wife owns Honor 6 which works well seeing which I had ordered 7X, but disappointed.",Negatif

I lile everything on this phone except the front camera i think it could be better. Ive been using this phone for a week and no problems or glitches. It is fast big and worth more than the price,Positif
"I'm pretty happy with the phone so far. Coming from a moto x pure (yeah downgrade) I never really used the specs. Also lenovo and motorolla I wasn't happy about. The battery was losing its life since I had for a couple of years. This phone is pretty snappy for the specs. I'm using spotify, and reddit mostly.

"Great phone, I use it with cricket wireless service, I just had to go to the store to get a nano sim card.",Positif
"This is a great low budget phone with lots of features. I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with this phone. Since I only use rooted phones, every time I rooted my Galaxy, I would start to experience severe lag times after about 1 month of use or less. I would then have to backup, factory reset and re-setup my phone with all of my hundreds of applications.
I have rooted the Honor 7x and so far it is working flawlessly.

The only reason for the 4 stars is because Honor has not provided the latest Android system available. I've seen rumors that an update is coming, but no official word from Honor regarding this.

A great job to the folks at Honor for producing a great product.",Positif
"great phone, easy to use and respond fast enough to running all apps!!",Positif

"For the first 3-4 weeks I had this phone it was great. I never experienced any hiccups or lag. Call quality was good. I did have some minor bluetooth connectivity issues but it was nothing major. More annoying than a problem. However, the phone bricked itself. I'm not crazy, I promise, and I'm not lying. I had turned off my phone every night since getting it. Last night, it seems to have decided it didn't like that because when I went to turn it on this morning it got stuck on the ""Honor Powered by Android"" blue screen. I tried holding the power button, holding the power button + the volume up button, nothing. It wouldn't even turn off. So sadly I had to return it and I likely won't be buying a replacement. I understand I'm probably one in a million to have such an issue, but I'd rather not take my chances buying something that turns into a $200 paperweight after a month.",Negatif

"I've had this phone for a little over 2 months and up until this last week I was thrilled with it. The body design is sleek and looks on par with bigger brand phones, and the interface had all the customization I love with androids as well as being user friendly and streamlined like apple products. It was a little glitchy or laggy with some higher memory usage apps like Snapchat and it doesn't do ""fast charging"" like the bigger brand phones do now, but overall I was over the moon with the performance and design of this phone for the price. However, in the last week when I plug it in to charge I've been noticing it either isn't charging all the way or it seems like the charge has decreased. I thought maybe I was unplugging it without thinking about it and then forgetting to plug it back in. But today it has almost completely stopped charging. I've tried 4 different chargers, including the one it came with, and it does not even acknowledge being plugged in.
I gave it 3 stars because while it took a charge, it was an awesome phone for the price. However, 2 months is a very short phone life. So if you're looking for a high quality-for-the-price phone for a short period of time, this phone would probably be perfect for you. But if you're looking for a phone to last and perform consistently for a long period of time, it's probably best to shell out a little more cash for higher quality.",Positif

"I have always used iPhones and bought this just to try out an Android phone. My previous phone was an iPhone 6s. I have been using it for my main phone for a couple of days and I really like it.

Pros:

Screen - The 18:9 screen is big and easy to use. The text is much sharper than on my iPhone (407 ppi vs 326 ppi on my iPhone). The viewing angles are a bit worse than my iPhone, but not by much. The display gets just as bright as my iPhone.

Batery life: It lasts quite a bit longer than my iPhone.

Build quality: The phone feels like it cost way more than $200, however the matte black version is like a fingerprint magnet.

Buttons: The power and volume buttons feel solid and not mushy.

Fingerprint scanner: The fingerprint scanner is so fast and accurate. Opens in less than half a second. Much faster than Touch ID gen 2.

Call quality: The sound from the earpiece is load and clear.

Camera: The secondary 2MP camera for wide aperture mode does not do such a good job at blurring out the background, however the primary sensor can capture very nice images on its own, especially closeups.

Cons:

WiFi and Bluetooth issue: When bluetooth is on Wifi speed drops significantly. This is because they share the same antenna, but I was still able to play 1080p YT videos to a bluetooth speaker, for $200 I can't really complain.

Main Speaker: It lacks mid and bass frequency and can easily be covered. My iPhones speaker was much better.

No 4k recording: This is due to a chipset limitation.

MicoUSB: At least you don't have to buy a bunch of new cables if you have a lot of microUSB cables.

No fast chrging: It charges as fast as my iPhone with the 1 amp charger.

--- After looking at my iPhone after using this, my iPhone just seems so ancient.",Positif

"This phone, although having great specs, is very slow. It crashes constantly with even simple applications (i.e. camera, video calling, messenger) and if you have over ten apps running in the background then you may have trouble receiving calls or instant messages as the phone takes too long to respond. Constantly I was unable to receive calls as the screen would freeze being unresponsive to touch. Switching applications is also problematic and forget trying to use maps to get anywhere.

"Either mine was defective or this has a 10 year old WiFi radio/receiver. I can't stream 480p or lower quality videos more than 10 feet from my router, more than 30 feet from my router websites take 1-2 minutes to load. I have devices hooked up all over my home that have no issues streaming video (Roku, game console, smart TV). I looked online for solutions thinking I have to be doing something wrong. Found a few (disable Bluetooth while streaming, software updates, etc.) but nothing made it better.

The display, which reviews indicated was a high point, is bad. Colors look washed out and muted. It has some sharpness to it, but the colors on my 3 year old Samsung J7 look much more vibrant. I tried messing around with all the display settings to no avail, simply can't make it look as good.

I give it an extra star because the design of the phone is sleek and the OS seemed snappy, but since it couldn't fulfill the basic promise of outperforming my outdated Samsung J7, it's hard to like much of anything.",Negatif
"Junk, Got the update to Oreo and after the update I have no screen notifications for calls, text messages and emails. Not even Honor's Support can't / won't figure out the fix. I opened a ticket with support and they keep giving me the run around..

Here is a copy of what i was told to do for the fix.

Frank C (Tue, 5/15/2018, 11:02:18 am)
We been having some issues with the recent updates but It's really helpful when people contact us as soon as you get any new update in order to let us know about any glitches/bugs the update might come with.
It might take up to a couple of days in order to get it.
Not all devices are updated at the same time since the updates are pushed in batches.
Just keep on checking the UPDATER option every week or so.
Try connecting it to different wifi networks.
And reboot it every 3-4 days.

This is just to get a fix..........

Update - 5-21-2018

After Oreo update..

Phone has been reset to factory defaults, Notifications have been changed again, changed sim, verified with provider no blocks on IMEI. Voice quality sounds like tin, Bluetooth drops even honor branded watches, Bluetooth wont stay connected to headphones. Charging extremely slow. Wifi slow and is hit or miss... Low light camera function leaves pictures dark and grainy. Zoom functionality for pictures are pretty bad. Touch screen only responds when it wants to.

Still no response from their support after opening ticket 6 days ago..

Update 5-24-2018

Honor support keeps contradicting their statements. our first chat he stated a few hours for a fix then in our second chat he stated 24 to 48 hours, finally they stated to check every week and reboot the phone…. So what am I supposed to do while I wait and wait for an update? I have a non-usable phone since I do not get alerts for texts, emails and phone calls coming in? Support stated the issue was resolved. It’s not resolved…. What patch am I waiting for? I have other branded phones “LG, Samsung and a Google Pixel” and when I contact support for an issue and they have to push out a patch for a fix it’s not done in batches as they state... it is usually within a day or less that I get a notification that a push is ready…. So far this is the worst customer service I’ve gotten from a phone manufacturer. They told me to turn the phone in to their service dept, what will happen is I will get a refurbished phone back and then my current 1 year warranty goes to only 90 days…. That
is what has happened with the Honor 8 and the Honor 6x that I cannot use anymore due to their support center broke and refuse to fix the phones they broke..

Stay away from Honor or Hauwei products",Negatif

ok, so i returned the phone and the replacement immediately hooked up with all three of my speakers. now i have a problem with the new

one. the touch screen is a PIA. it is unresponsive towards the outer edges necessitating pushing several times to get a response.

"Update: Been using it for a week now, and still love it! **Check using willmyphonework.net to make sure your carrier will work on the phone your interested in**

So my last phone was a samsung Note 3. I had it Forever. But the Crack in the screen and slow lagging on this phone was starting to get to me. So was researching some phones that were 400 bucks and under. Based on lots of online reviews on YouTube and Google and of course here. I decided to try this phone. It is awesome. I love how it's android and also like the iphone. Pretty neat. I know it doesn't charge quickly but neither did my old phone so I'm ok with that. I'm not a power user. Just mostly for texting, phone and occasional social media, news etc. This is a great phone blows my old note 3 phone away.
**Also read on many blogs and news media that the honor 7x will be one of the lucky phones to get the new oreo update very soon** Can't wait for that!
This phone just keeps getting better each day. I'm really loving it. And at this price, can't beat it!",Positif
wonderful mobile.,Positif
Amazing!!,Positif
"Is a very nice device, but beware. You need a screenprotector. Whenever i put the phone in the pocket if my jeans, the screan gains little tiny scratches and some bigger scratches past the middle of the screen.",Positif
"It’s a decent phone for what you pay for it. I purchased the phone to upgrade my personal HTC Desire during Amazon Prime Day. I have an iPhone for work so don’t use my personal phone too often. It does what I need it to do, make calls, send messages, read my email and surf the net. It also takes decent pictures.

It does get boggy and unresponsive at times. I have to remind myself to make sure I hard exit any apps I’ve been on. Sometimes the keyboard doesn’t react when you are trying to type. I have issues connecting Google Maps to my Ford Fusion. I can connect the calling feature with no issues.

I would recommend the phone if you need the basics and don’t want to get into a long lease with a major carrier.

Update:
I am updating my review to a single star. For the last week I have not been able to receive or send any MMS messages. I called my carrier, T Mobile and they weren’t able to help me. It is not an authorized phone for them so they do not have any specs for it. I’m going to try Hauwei next. But everything I’ve read online they are no help.",Negatif
"Past phones: Moto droid, droid x, droid x2 droid razor, S5, V20, Note 5, Note 7, Moto G5, and some other low end phones. Nothing beats the note 7 before it was bricked though.
I am really impressed with the phone for several reasons.
PRO:
The phone construction is great, camera is better than expected for a low level phone (about the same as the S5, but not as good as the Note7 or V20 and better than the others listed above), button feel is perfect, color is as advertised, screen looks good and the brightness level is way better than expected and much brighter than my Moto G4, speaker volume is very loud, but tonaly quality isn't that great but not as bad as others I have had. I really like the overlay of the gui and the options for customization are close to flagship level and equal or better than other big brands I have had. Response time of the processor is good and not a let down, the 3 gig ram seems fine for the phone also. Battery life is great and closely 30% longer lasting than the G4 I still have. The real surprise is the fingerprint sensor and how well it perfectly and instantly recognises several programed fingers. The Note7 was a joke in comparison .

CONS:
What I dislike is the fact the touch screen anywhere around the edges is kinda iffy, not really responsive at all. Using it as a hotspot is worthless as the speed is a joke and not even capable of playing youtube vids at a 240p setting. I still have 2 other working phones for a direct network comparo and this phone just sucks for use as a hotspot. My only SLIGHTLY MINOR COMPLAINT, is that this thing is slippery! lol Good thing they included the slim fitting, great quality cover/case for it. Given the battery life the last complaint is that it isn't a fast charging phone at all, but being that it needs charged less often that other phones I can still get a 12.5hr work day out of it before it dies. I have not charged it for 2 days on my days off, so the battery life is great in general, but having the turbo charge that other phones offer is still lacking on this phone. Again, just a minor con.

Overall:
I really like it and would buy it again if needed, but the lack of it being a hotspot is a big issue for me, as I used my last 2 phones a lot for this as my home wifi blows in some rooms and could use the phone to stream through the pc, smart tv, and the roku with ease for netflix movies. This phone just completely fails in that regard. Because of this I am wanting to give it 3 stars, but as it works so well in all other areas I will gift it an extra star and give it a 4.",Positif
"I love Honor. I had an Honor5 before and it was great and this one really doesn't dissapoint. Great features & performance for an affordable price. In addition, the chance to carry 2 SIM cards at the same time really comes in handy when you're travelling and you want to have a local line.",Positif
"I usually don't write review for products however i feel compelled to write one for this phone. First of all if you buy this phone for the camera, don't do it as it is terrible. I use the camera of my phone daily for work i have to send reports and at least good pictures, in the past i had a camera for this purpose, however as cellphone cameras became better and better this was not necessary until this phone. The previous phone i had was a Xiaomi Mi4C and it was a great phone for its price range of about 150 bucks the detail on that camara was far superior to this one and it was supposed to be worse in paper. The dual camera is a good gimmick for Facebook pictures with simulated out of focus areas but that's about it, if you want detailed pictures this is not a good phone, specially for macro. Also the colors are off
Now on to the rest of the phone its alright i guess, good memory. The sound is really low. It feels sturdy.",Positif
"I love this phone, Sleek, great photos, only complaint, the volume is not as loud as I would like.",Positif
"This phone is absolutely amazing! I love how fast it processes, the beautiful screen, amazing picture quality, excellent voice quality on calls. The battery is stellar... I usually only have to charge it every other day, but I rarely stream video or play intense games. I highly recommend this phone, especially for the price - it can't be beat!",Positif
"My camera keeps freezing up, pages will freeze up. Not truly happy with the phone but will do until I can afford a better one. Some apps either lock up or won't come on at all. This phone is not worth buying",Negatif
"I've had this phone for about 24 hours, and it has exceeded all of my expectations. I am coming from an iPhone 5S, so the large and beautiiful screen alone makes this phone worth the $200 investment. The software is clean and the build quality is similar to phones that are triple the price. Also, the phone came with a nice clear case. While the camera is not perfect, it has many adjustable settings and is more than suitable for my needs. If you are tired of spending way too much on cell phones, this phone is for you.",Positif

I was one of the first to purchase this phone. Excited at first butt now regret my purchase.

"This seems like an incredible phone, but the version I received wouldn't work on AT&T - AT&T even sent me a new sim card in case it was something to do with my existing sim. But when they put the phone's serial number into the system, it showed up as linked to Verizon and not actually unlocked. Giving it 2 stars simply because the phone itself seems high quality, but I will have to return it.",Negatif
"Worse unlock phone I have got from Amazon thus far , this phone is slow this phone does not respond to touch very well this phone's camera only works half the time and when it does it is so slow to respond this is not a good phone for the money",Negatif
"Such a cool phone!! I was really worried about the SIM card situation but it transferred seamlessly!! My last phone was a Galaxy Express 3, so this is an upgrade. Love the customizability. Only drawbacks SO FAR: phone charges SO SLOWLY and is heating up, but that's probably because of how much I'm using it. It has such cool features and I'm excited to have such a great phone",Positif
"Don't buy this phone if you are going to use snapchat, Instagram or camera on this phone. this phone is very slow and freezes when ever you need it the most. i restart this phone few times a day to use it. phone goes crazy when it freeze and their is no way you will survive a day without restarting. this phone is not for kids, i would say this phone is only worth it for old people due to big screen and long life battery.",Negatif
For the price is a amazing mobile,Positif
"Good: decent price, large screen, comes with a transparent sleeve, nice color, try to get version with larger RAM
Bad: a bit slow with latest android update
Ugly: 16 Megapixel camera is not as good as my note 4.",Positif
"I purchased two of these phones, one for myself and one for my wife. Both phones freeze up constantly when more than one app is running. We find ourselves rebooting the phones around 4 times per day.",Negatif
"At first the phone works good but after the second month, phone screen went blank. Have to wait for 20 mintue for phone to start working again. It's driving me crazy. Worse phone.",Negatif
"This is a great phone for the price, no regrets here. My use case for a phone is GPS, messaging, email, quick reference on the web, quick reminder photos, etc. So I'm not exactly a power user.

Pros:
Price
Fairly Recent security updates.
Fingerprint sensor works fast, reliably.
Battery life is great.
Dual SIM

Cons:
A little sluggish sometimes, not too bad though. Not a phone for gamers.
Camera is a bit meh, but again refer to price.

So far so good, better than expected even, with the exception of iMessage and multimedia bugs that I think are more fruit based than Huawei or Googles fault. I don't love the security news, don't love being even more inside Big G's ecosystem, but the $800 still in my pocket are too important in my budget for me to be a chooser.",Positif
Two months with phone. Placed it up for sale on Craigslist yesterday. Like size screen colors. Don't like the processor. My cracked up galaxy j7 feels faster to touch and to do just about everything. This phone was clearly what I needed to let me know I need more than a 3g memory mid-low snapdragon processor set up. Worst: laggy camera. Won't miss this phone.,Positif
"I do like the phone but the size is just too large for me. I have the Honor 5X and love it, which is why I bought the 7X. Great phone but again, for me it's just too large.",Positif
"First.
Out of the Box. The GPS on this is highly inaccurate. It would ""drift"" upwards of a half mile away. It would never steadily track my location from the moment I turned the phone on. I factory reset the phone twice nothing fixed this. Also I'm located in New York City...this isn't pennsyltucky or the amazon river basin. I also set the GPS onto all 3 different settings (GPS only, wifi + gps, cell+wifi+gps) still...massive issues driving or using running apps. this phone in particular is discouraged by major running apps like strava for this exact issue (amongst others like the battery optimization garbage which i also turned off).

second. water resistance is horrible on this phone. i was caught in the rain. phone had a case on. i got pretty wet, that's fair but rather than the usb port being damaged or condensation in the camera the SIM CARD PORT someone stopped functioning? Sim card has one of those trays and is located 3-4 mm into the phone. ""Water Damage"" voided my warranty despite the phone becoming useless due to a sim port issue. I no longer could use my cellular network, otherwise phone was working as normal.

third. the screen is very cheap. mine cracked while in my jeans as i was sitting down. the stress of denim fabric apparently bent the phone just enough to crack the screen. i wear some tight jeans, i'll admit, but this has never happened before with any other phone, including larger ones.

i, like everyone who reads this, have owned a lot of cellphones. the issues i had with this one were especially bad.

I'd highly recommend a moto-g or LG aristo for simple budget phones that won't end up costing you MORE money like this Hew-way honor.",Negatif
"The screen is quite clear, the speed respectable, the fingerprint reader surprisingly accurate and the overall execution amazing at is price point.",Positif
"It's a beautiful phone but unfortunately it freezes a lot. I can not have several apps open because it stops working correctly, either freezing or getting very slow.",Positif
No brainer for $200.,Positif
Don't buy this phone within in 6 weeks the charger port and fingerprint sensor broke. Even after contacting manufacturer no help. Save your money,Negatif
"my brother has one it pretty good in most of its feature but the screen is easily crack if u drop it to often, if ur getting this don't get it from this seller very poor service on refund and inspection also cheap and non flexible depend on whats was done to their product,20% percent for restocking the only thing touch was but the tape for 20% this is what i call rigged, good phone just don't get it from this seller",Positif
"Amazing phone for the price. Biggest issue is the screen is sometimes not responsive. Also the phone tends to slow down significantly if your multitasking, that issue is resolved if you access developer options and turn off animations etc...",Positif
This phone is excellent. It has a nice size screen and the camera is excellent quality. I notice a few bugs in the software but nothing major considering it is a cheap Android phone. For the price it definitely can compete with major phones.,Positif
"Phone is great. Much better than wasting $700 on a Galaxy or iPhone. Screen breaks easy though. I just dropped it lightly with a screen protector on, and the screen cracked, covering the front lens :(",Positif
Fast and user friendly . Much better than I anticipated,Positif
"I have had the phone for 4 months now. Battery life is not as good. I don't use the phone that much, but still need to charge it almost every day.",Positif
"Great phone I loved it unfortunately had to send it back because it would not work on straight talk for me. I called and called and the BYOP service doesn’t work with it. Just a heads up. Sad I had to send it back, for me it’s better than my iPhone 7. The back camera is amazing the front is still an android camera. Never lagged or froze on me. Great phone 10/10-ign",Positif
"I've never had a more glitchy, laggy phone. It's beautiful, thin, light, and does what it's supposed to -- about 75% of the time. But the constant freezing up and various glitches, which weren't present in those same apps on a different Huawei phone, are just too frustrating to put up with.",Positif
"This is a great phone, I have no complaints!",Positif
"Just received this phone yesterday and it's awesome! It's slim but still heavy, feels durable and the screen is clear and goes all the way to the edge of the phone so it's not a clunky phone, feels good in your hand. Switched my cricket Sim card over with easy no problem. It's fast and the camera is great! Definitely worth the$$ ????",Positif
everyone need a back up phone,Positif
"The good. It looks and feels good in the hand battery life is great. I May still return it. I have 7 more days i believe. The CPU bottlenecks more than i'd like. Messages have to be downloaded in mms which i've tried to fix 1000 different ways clearing the cache sometimes helps. Sometimes it doesn't, i can't seem to figure out why it does this. Then when it says you need to download the message it will fail. It has restarted a few times. I also have a video of it locking up or bottle necking. This was out of a lock screen nothing was running in the back ground. I could understand if it was over loaded. It does not like nova launcher. There's a lot to like and a lot to dislike. Everything is up to date on the phone. I just think i might have not hit the silicone lottery with this one and the CPU in mine just isn't up to pair with the rest of the honor 7x's. I'll give it until over the weekend and see if i can work out the quarks if not i'm going to send it back. I want it to be a good phone.",Positif
Great phone for the price. Occasionally call quality is less than other phones I’ve had in the past. Easy to switch from iPhone.,Positif
"DISAPPOINTED
DOESN'T WORTH BUYING FOR $??",Negatif
he likes it!!!!,Positif
"I didn't read in reviews of Honor 7X the exclusive use of nano sim but discovered NANO SIM ONLY which would require purchasing $25.00 nano sim thereby wiping out the Prime Day savings ... unfortunately, will return and seek another replacement that uses micro sim.",Positif
Pleasantly surprised and very happy with this phone read a lot of reviews before we purchased,Positif
Awesome phone. I highly recommend it.,Positif
"Great phone, totally recommend!
The thing is, it is a mix of IPhone and Android phones. Many of its features are copied off of IPhone, yet it is still Android like. I totally love this mix. Works great! Also, it's cheap! Cheap iPhone) Good phone!",Positif
I had another Huawei before this and issue I had was only one speaker worked. Another was stolen and my current one has an issue with the touch screen. I have to tap more twice before it works. Does anyone else have similar issues.,Positif

"Replaced an iPhone 5S, and this is a massive upgrade. Truly a budget phone that can compete with flagship phones.",Positif
"I really love this phone so far. My one complaint is when I try to touch things that are really close to the edge of the screen, I sometimes have to touch it several times before it will finally sense that I am touching the screen. Annoying yes, deal breaker, no.

Update 4/4/2018
Well, I have had this phone for a month and there is a small crack on the side of the screen already!! I am not happy.",Negatif
Thank you!!!,Positif
"It's an okay phone, but it freezes up a lot, and the System crashes. The camera is awesome though.",Positif
"It works with T mobile, has Wi Fi phone feature , 4g LTE and worth every penny spend .",Positif
"I will give a five star for the price! Its a not flagship phone, so I cant expect much from it. The screen resolution is great! Good battery. It gets a bit slow after intense use.",Positif
"Great phone at great price! You cannot go wrong with your decision.
Pros:
- Solid built
- Great screen and screen size
- Speakers are of decent volume (for a $200 standpoint)
- Very slim
The biggest peace of mind is, I am spending only $200 for such a great phone and if I loose or break - who cares!",Positif
For that price is a great phone....,Positif
So far still good only 1thing sounds like the camera lens is lose so there like a raddle,Positif
I'm comletly satisfied with the device. It entirely met my expectations.,Positif
"What I liked:
Best display available for the price at the time of this review. The proprietary Emui interface is really pretty and works like a charm. Split screen functionality is super useful. Fingerprint sensor works perfectly.
Build quality feels amazing. Metal body feels like a much more expensive phone.
Super slim

What I don't like:
The speaker is terrible. I had read other reviews that mentioned this and thought nothing of it, but it's really tinny sounding, no bass at all. It's a bigger deal than I thought it would be.
There are no great screen protectors for this phone! Not sure why. Best I've found so far is a skinomi TechSkin.
The only other issues are the sorts of things you expect on a $200 phone.
No USB-C
No fast charging
Not as much RAM as I'd like
Etc.
As I said no real issues yet, just budget level everything.

CONCLUSION:
Great phone for the price. Probably the best sub $500 phone available.",Positif
After 4 months. My GPS of this phone stopping working .,Negatif
"So far I am unhappy with the phone. My previous experience with Huawei had been pleasant, but this phone is far away from that. It keeps lagging, screen does not response as quick as my previous Xiaomi Red Mi Note 3. The fact of not having physical buttons is a aesthetic pkus, but the ""on screen buttons"" aint as responsive as I think they should.

Maybe all my concerns are software related. I hope Huawei can fix them, otherwise I will foind my self using this a brick for papers.",Negatif

Great phone,Positif
"It's hard for me to recommend this device, with so many issues i had, I know it's probably bad luck for me, but I had heard so many good things from honor that I was willing to try.

The phone, the hardware is great, it's hard to believe this is a ""budget"" phone, premium and with great specs, but on the other hard, the software experience is really bad, I would love this product if this would be offered on an Android Go/One Version

As for my ""real issue"", my phone came defective, screen kept turning off for 30 seconds to 1 min, had to lock it and unlock it a bunch of time, I thought I didn't knew how to use it, since i came from iOS, but then eventually it turned off and wouldn't turn on back, I thought it was the battery but when I receive a call and the screen was blank , while the phone ringing , I knew i had to ask for a refund.

If you get it, and it works great for you, I believe you, it was just not for me",Negatif
"The phone looks and is made very well. It's a shame that the phone is so slow and laggy taking a picture is nearly impossible. This is the slowest, laggiest phone I have ever used. I will be returning. Unless mine is defective. Which I doubt.",Negatif
"I have trouble streaming live TV. The stream is choppy. I put my old phone side-by-side and streamed the same TV program simultaneously, the infinix continued to stream while the honor chopped up the video. The phone is a problem to me. Short battery life. It does not wanna play wma files. It does not recognize them as audio files. Plays mp3 just fine. Good technical support.",Positif
You cannot easily remove the battery to reset or replace. Even the repair shop had a hard time and cracked the screen. The Honor app for customer support does not work in the US. When the phone was working fine... It was fine. Once anything starts to go wrong (cracked screen in my case)... The phone is useless and costs a lot to fix if it can even be fixed.,Negatif
Purchased this phone because it was suppose to be water resistent. I accidently dropped it in a small puddle. It worked for 3 hours and then died on me. This phone is not water proof.,Negatif
"When it has more of 10 apps open it gets very very slow and you have to close all the apps for the phone to come to normal speed again, but in general its beatiful, has good cameras, screen and a very resistant body for the price",Positif
Best packaging and fast shipping by Amazon Prime. This phone is the Real Budget King. Super Fluid and best budget dual Camera!!!!!,Positif
Nice but make sure you have a nano SIM card I really wanted it to work for me . but not in the Stars,Positif
"Nice looking phone but I couldn't use it with Verizon service.
Could not make or receive phone calls.",Negatif
"Nothing to envy to a way more expensive pone like the IPhone, great screen, easy to use and amazing prize.",Positif
"This phone seems kind of... broken? There's huge lag whenever I try to do anything with it (Press a button? Wait a couple of seconds for that to register. Want to switch between apps? More waiting). It doesn't stop playing music when someone calls me, apps keep crashing on it, and it generally seems buggy and slow. Pretty disappointing.",Negatif
Freezes constantly has constant advertisement making it almost impossible to open,Negatif
This is a piece of trash. Crashes on a daily basis. Very frustrating. Don't buy it just because it looks cool. Might as well buy an iPhone 6s instead of this garbage.,Negatif
"For what you're getting for $200 is amazing. So far, I've enjoyed the phone, but I've experienced some lag when running multiple applications. Very random, but Snapchat is almost unusable on this phone. It will lock the entire phone up, and will require a reboot at times.

The cameras are decent. No issues. Battery life is amazing. Screen is extra sharp and vibrant. My real only complaint might be the 3gb of RAM in the US variant I have.

I will give it maybe another week to see if I can deal with the lag, or if it subsides. It started lagging while writing this review...",Positif
Slow,Positif
Everything on the phone is great except the camera.,Positif
"FALSE ADVERTISING!
They claim the phone is unlocked.

 Honor 7X - 18:9 screen ratio, 5.93"" full-view display. Dual-lens camera. Unlocked Smartphone, Black (US Warranty

I received mine and immediately discovered it is NOT UNLOCKED. I paid for what was described and I was lied to. You decide whether you want the phone but know this, it will be locked. it will NOT be rooted. You will NOT have root access!",Positif
"This phone has been terrible. Constantly lagging and locking up. I had hoped a recent update would have solved the issues, but no better. I find myself having to clear running apps constantly and apps and screen touches take forever to respond most of the time. If I could give a zero star rating I would do so.",Negatif
"The phone looks and feels amazing, my prev phone was a Galaxy S6, all the good reviews made me buy the honor BUT after two days of use the phone started to freeze up and not work. Most of the time you switch to the camera it will crash or it will take forever to load, making you change your mind about taking a pic in the first place. The phone would crashed at least 3 times per day, way too much in my opinion. I got the one with the 3GB ram so maybe the good reviews go towards the 4GB ram. I replaced it with a MOTO phone and Im loving it",Negatif
its ok phone but after a week of using it is laggy and camera not working good.. maybe a heavy ui. return it today not satisfied with the phone. i dont know why those youtube reviewer got impressed with this phone and a lot of people returning it. maybe they are paid by huawei to make the phone lok good,Negatif
"Everything about this phone is great ,except one important thing ,the processor .The phone lags so bad ,it's almost impossible to open the camera at times .. very disappointed but it's a good phone when it isn't lagging",Negatif

The phone screen shattered very easily. Very expensive haven't had it six weeks and phones garage. Warranty only 30 days!,Negatif

Fraud stay away,Negatif
"Hey all! I hope you all find this review super helpful: I'm going to break this review up into what I consider the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I'll reverse the order and start with the

UGLY: This phone is extremely slippery. It slips on couches, beds, tables, pretty much any surface. A case is mandatory if you want to keep this phone protected. Luckily, there is one included in the box! Because it's slippery it also gets scratched easily. I have a small crack on the front unfortunately after my 3rd week with the phone. Lastly, the charging time is unremarkable. If you ever had a Flagship phone and used quick charging you will be disappointed. This phone takes well over 2 hours to charge.

THE BAD: This phone has no NFC. Personally, not a big deal at all for me but maybe something worth noting for those who use Android payments. The software isn't like the Nokia 6.1 or Moto G6. Pretty much those phones have vanilla Android with no bloatware. This phone will have bloatware and that may/may not be a dealbreaker for you. Again, personally, I don't mind but maybe you want a smoother experience. I use Nova Launcher and I am perfectly happy. Finally, the phone looks... generic. There's nothing about this phone that stands out but then again it's super cheap!!

THE GOOD (MY FAVORITE PART!): Dat Aluminum Build quality though! Unlike my Moto G5+ (previous phone) I actually want to caress my fingers all over the brushed aluminum. It feels very cool to the touch and premium. Honestly, if I didn't know the price beforehand I would think this phone cost 2x or 3x as much! It's right up there with the iPhone 6S+. I know I just bashed this phone for being generic but the fact that this phone feels so damn premium for so little is amazing! The battery life has continued to impress me. Not sure what Huawei did but the 3340 MAH battery last easily throughout the day, I could get 40, sometimes 50% at the end of a night. And even in heavy usage, it will be at 30%. The near bezel-less display is amazing for a phone so cheap. You literally get a screen that's nearly on par with Flagships. It gives way more room for content and maximizes screen real estate. Oh, and movies and games look glorious. Tons of features!! One-handed mode, multi-window, Night Mode, double tap to wake, notification shade gesture using the fingerprint scanner, App Twin, Navigation Dock, and wayyy more. Performance is great and despite being a low-end chip I have experienced very little lag. Runs efficiently without any slowdowns. Anyone who wants a decent pic at a very affordable price is in for a surprise. After using Moto G6, Nokia 6.1, and even the Moto X4 from last year this is probably (I'm not a professional here) the best camera in its price point. Lots of filters, plenty of editing options, and the camera even have pro mode for further enhancements.

Conclusion: Even the bad things aren't deal breakers. I don't really need NFC (and I doubt any of you will). Slapping a launcher on this makes it even more customizable and smoother. The phone looking generic really doesn't matter when even most flagships struggle to stand out.",Positif
I really liked the phone but within 12 hours it went into a permanent update that it never recovered from. I had to return it the next day. It was such an easy phone to use and activate. Too bad that happened.,Negatif
"I purchased directly from the Huawei Honor website, but I feel like Amazon is a large enough market and should get to hear what my experience was with the product.

In short, for the abysmally low price of $200, you will not get a better everyday phone for average media consumption. The screen is beautiful and massive. The performance, going from app to app and opening things one after another is snappy. Camera is just generically beautiful.

However, do not buy this for PRIMARILY gaming. This phone has a pretty good CPU, BUT the GPU (the hardware that makes a big impact in gaming) is quite mediocre. Now please don't think that this means it's bad phone; it's not at all. I can still play the normal, farmville-type games without any issues. It's just games like Asphalt 8 and such will be a little slow (But not unplayable, mind you).

That being said, you also need to understand that outside of gaming, the phone is spectacular. Smoother than butter, with minor glitches that any android device can have. Coming from an iPhone, I just love the amount of file management you can do on android, and with the large screen on the device, it feels like a legitimate portable ""work computer."" More so, the split screening and youtube picture in picture mode works really well, without any lag.

And good god, that fingerprint sensor is so freaking fast. It feels like the phone can sense your thoughts before you even put the finger down.
So what's the takeaway? If you're down to $200 - this phone every time. If looking specifically for a GAMING phone (primary use) - no, save the trouble and don't give the 7x a bad name. In fact, I think this is a great phone for grandparents, because if its massive screen, low cost, high performance, and the android ""simple mode"" feature along with floating docks and such.",Positif
"Great phone I waiting a month to get it on Amazon and it is worth a lot more then 199. I needed a new phone as since updating my iPhone 6s Plus that phone is resetting and really slow . I am not spending $900 on a new Apple 8 or Samsung.
I am very happy with this phone .
There is the news that huawaei phones may be spying on you that came out yesterday. Well I got news for you the NSA spies on you with the iPhone and all android phones . Verizon was going to carry this phone but was pressured not to at the last minute.
I researched this phone for 6 months before buying it.
My recommendation get it",Positif
"Wow, I bought this phone for my wife initially but it was taking longer than I wanted to wait so bought the Le Pro 3 too, it came quicker. Well I thought I was going to return this phone because I and my wife fell for the Le Pro 3 so hard, but once I played with this phone, it was over. it doesn't have as much of the little tweaks as the Le Pro 3 but it is rock solid, actually Rockstar solid. The camera is slightly better than the Pro 3, and the feel is also a little better. The UI reminds me of Nova Launcher, it is quick, has enough geek tweaks to keep me occupied for a while. I like this phone so much that I parked my Galaxy S7. The one big deal so far for me has been the slow motion movie, it is subpar, it seems to drop a couple of f stops (depending on how you view f stops) the images got super dark when I chose slow motion and the software did not recognize the beginning set point. I will reconsider if i want to take a star away for that, i will see if there is an App to address that issue ( another reason I love androids, there is generally an alternative to solve a problem).

I will update after using this while out with friends and family, but there is no way I am parting with this phone even with it's slight shortcoming.",Positif
"I've had this phone for a week now and love it so far. The phone feels very solid and has a beautiful display. The fingerprint sensor on the back has worked flawlessly and it is so nice to be able to turn a phone on with just a finger touch on the back. It is blazing fast and has performed flawlessly. My son who purchased the Note 8 said he would have purchased this phone had it seen it before buying the Note. This is an exceptional phone for the money.

UPDATE: After using this phone for a couple of months I still feel this is by far the best phone for the price. I've noted that it periodically needs to be rebooted. I've also had some issues with the camera responding very slowly. I checked last night and I was low on storage which may have been causing the problem with the camera. I deleted some files and apps and I will see if that fixes the camera slowness. I put a simple Spigen case on the phone and have since dropped it twice. It has sustained no damage whatsoever. It easily has enough charge for the day. I use it with a Samsung watch and so it advises me that the Samsung app is consuming a lot of power, but I have never run out. I did notice some hesitation at times when using the browser or apps. After researching the issue I found that the phone only has one antennae for both wireless and bluetooth. I turn off bluetooth when I'm not using it and that alleviates the problem. One antennae is the price of a higher end phone at a low price. Everybody I have showed the phone to has been impressed with its solid feel and nice screen. I was disappointed to see a big box store drop the Huawei line. I believe it is under pressure from other phone makers that want to keep the price elevated. Again, if you want a really good phone at an affordable price - this is the phone for you.",Positif
"Unfortunately, i'm going to have to return this phone. I wanted to love it, everything about it seemed perfect. Large display, great battery, nearly vanilla android, dual camera, dual sim, speedy processor for the price. It seemed like a dream come true! Except, for one extremely important thing:

This phone does not have 5G Wifi. I will admit, i honestly did not even look at this spec when i was researching the phone, but it virtually cripples the phone. I live in an apartment building in downtown Austin, the phone is completely unusable when on Wifi. 2G Wifi works fine if there is not a lot of wifi signals around you, but in an urban setting with routers everywhere, it is so slow i can't even load google without waiting for a minute. Email doesn't work, pages don't load, app store is unusable....just forget about it. As soon as i turn Wifi off it springs to life, but unfortunately without the wifi i can't install updates, or install many apps, or do anything useful really without crippling my data plan.

Huawei, i wanted to be a believer and i really thought i had found a great phone, but i guess you get what you pay for.

Cheers.",Negatif
"Purchased this phone as a replacement for a One Plus Two phone that took an unfortunate water bath. I was looking for a phone that would do everything well for someone who does not game heavily on the phone and does not really require a high end chip set.

The build quality of the phone is excellent with a beautiful screen and well laid out buttons and fingerprint sensor. The phone looks like a $800 phone. The performance of the phone is fine with no issues after two weeks of use. There is no lag when switching screens and the camera works quickly producing very nice images.

Not sure I am in love with the 18:9 screen ratio. The screen seems slightly narrow for typing but it does help

The bottom line is that is this phone represents the best value in the smartphone market today and it rivals the performance of phones costing $400. You are certainly giving up performance and speed when comparing it to more expensive phones. You could buy 4 of these phones or 1 Apple or Samsung phone. And those phones are NOT four times better than this phone. The raw processing speed maybe that much better...but not the rest of the phone.

If your looking for a good smartphone that looks great....this is it. And your not going to be crushed if something happens to it.",Positif
"My previous phone was a Moto X, and I literally despised everything about it, and started researching for the best phone under $250.
The honor 7 had the best specs and very favorable reviews. I've now had it for almost 3 months and I absolutely love everything about it. Fast and easy to use, and incredible battery life! I use it constantly, often browsing or playing a game while listening to audiobooks or music, and I have to remind myself to go ahead and charge it every few days, even though it rarely gets below 50%.
I've also dropped it dozens of times without any issue.
Calls are crystal clear. External speaker is great, I had actually bought an Anker Bluetooth speaker, but returned it, because (at least for audiobooks) I preferred the phone speaker.
Love the large screen too. Overall a great phone, and nothing comes close to it in terms of value for the money.",Positif
"I must say this is a excellent budget phone.
We picked 1 up from honor in Dec. Received Dec 20th.
I use a galaxy s7 wife uses the honor. But I used the honor 7x for a few days prior to giving it to her.

The battery lasted my normal all day use with plenty left over. Possibly 1.5 days. While I charge my galaxy s7 2-3x a day.

Only cons for me is no wireless charging.
And mine had a small scratch on the back when I received.

Cons for others
No usb c
No fast charging
No nfc

The performance of the phone is very good. The camera works great. I'm looking @ getting myself a honor 7x or better. Then giving the s7 to our 2.5yr old.

Also I rated 4 stars mainly due to the scratch.

Now need to find a good screen protector and case.",Positif
Phone keep powering off during the day. Can’t find out what the reason is.,Negatif
"This phone is “okay” for $200. I had the iPhone 6s before buying this phone and im extremely happy with the battery life of this 7x. Yeah sometimes it lags and its buggy to the point that you get irritated but aye... $200!.... my main complaint is that for whatever reason the headphone jack is JACKED UP! I plug in my headphones and NOTHING. Music still comes out of phones speakers and not the headset... and for a music addict like myself, this is a NOO NOOOO! This is a “brand new” device right? No excuses",Negatif
"Best 18:9 display in the market in the sub $200. Specs, design and performance at this price is second to none. Period.
You can surely compare it to flagship devices and you might find that does not have the same performance that a $800-$1200 phone has. However, some of it's features are fairly close. If you want a right price, capable-ready, and fully functional phone, this should be in your top choices.",Positif
"Pros:
• Beautiful picture quality.
• Decent processing and WiFi loading speed.
• Lots of Bloatware, but none embedded. Can remove at your leisure.
• THE PRICE.

Cons:
• Phone does not open back cover to reveal battery, SIM cards, or MicroSD cards. Instead there's a small drawer that comes out when you push a small tool into a hole.
• Headphones are REALLY quiet, even at max volume it's quiet.
• SIM card incompatibility, I had Boost Mobile and transferring the SIM card did nothing. Many carriers and networks don't support this phone. There are plenty of BYOP (Bring-Your-Own-Phone) plans that claim to work with this phone.
• Can't find the passwords to Wifi I'm connected to.",Positif
"After years of running mainstream phones (iphone, Samsung, HTC, LG), I believe I can say ""never again"". I've only been using the 7X for a couple of weeks, but it's my new favorite. Apparently I'm not alone because my phone was back-ordered for a week or two. So far, it's been worth the wait. The phone looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. I don't do a lot of gaming, but everything I've done has worked well.
If you are coming from a phone that uses a micro-SIM, you'll need to get a new SIM from your network vendor as this phone only takes a nano-Sim, but that was my only (brief) hangup.
UPDATE(3/18/18): I'm still a fan of the phone, but one characteristic that could be troublesome for some buyers is the WiFi performance. First, it only supports 2.4Ghz wifi. This shouldn't be too big a deal, by itself. Secondly, the WiFi antenna is shared with the Bluetooth radio. This causes a significant decrease in WiFi performance when using Bluetooth. For instance, in my house, with Bluetooth turned off, I get speeds in the 22-25Mbps range (download). If I turn on the Bluetooth and connect my headset, that will drop to around 15-18Mbps. If I start my podcast player, so I'm actually listening to content via Bluetooth, it drops further, to the 3-7Mbps range.
Since most of my content consumption is pre-downloaded content (podcasts, mostly), this doesn't affect me much, and I had not noticed until someone else with the phone (actually a nearly identical Mate SE) mentioned it, and I did my own testing.

UPDATE(6/21/18): Still using it, still like the daily experience fine. Since the last review, the software on phone has gotten two updates, one to a ""Project Treble"" based Android 8.1, and the second update just a periodic security/bugfix update. So, I can't say I'm disappointed by the software support. However, in the last couple of weeks, Huawei announced that they're no longer going to support opening the bootloader on these (or any of their other) phones, so I'm not quite as happy overall.",Positif
"I rarely ever review, but I'm so disappointed with this phone. First off the FBI ,and CIA, have both issued warnings about using Huwaie phones. Secondly, this phone is so buggy!! I really wanted to like it , the display is great, the design is flawless, and camera is good when it works correctly. With all that said the problem lies within. The phone just doesn't work well at all. It's so slow while on the internet, it stalls out a lot, the charge is lackluster, taking pictures is a chore and can take up to 30 seconds to work correctly , and typing can drive a sane person into an asylum.I hope I purchased a defective phone, but given the warnings from the FBI I'm returning it , and never looking back.",Negatif
"This is a great phone especially for the price! I got this for my daughter to use on the Cricket network. Hooked it up with no issue. Great service and durable. but, the camera is hands down the best!!!! I now make her take all the pics anytime we go anywhere. I'm about to order this phone for myself I am so impressed!",Positif
"my husband ordered these phones when we needed new ones, we thought it would be cheaper than going with Samsung. boy were we wrong! they worked amazingly well in the beginning, but after having them for about 3 months the GPS started to go haywire, and the reception was terrible. they also started dropping calls like crazy. so we had to order new phones about 6 months or so later because they deteriorated so fast.",Negatif
"I've had this phone for a few months. Ordered it off of the hihonor website because it was back-ordered here. Since my Nexus 5x had bootlooped I couldn't wait a week+ for it to get here. Here is my review:

Performance 7/10
------------------
Does 90% of what I need it to when I need it. I am by no means a power user, I have no social media apps on my phone and use it to mostly check the news, navigate, and make calls. Biggest gripes is the occasional hang up on apps, where it will not load data when I tell it to. For example, sometimes I'll click on a link and nothing will happen. It's not an app problem, but a problem with the phone. Phone gets really bogged down if you are trying to run multiple apps at once (ie phone navigation, listening to an audiobook over bluetooth, checking messages). As many others have mentioned the camera is VERY slow. I am not exaggerating when I say it takes 10-15 seconds for the app to fully fire up and allow you to take pictures. Don't expect to capture any kodak moments with this phone.

Interface/OS 8/10
------------
I didn't really like EMUI, so I downloaded the nova launcher. A lot more slick. After making that change early on, I'm still waiting on the EMUI 8 update which I have yet to get. However, I am not going to complain much for a phone that does what I need it to do.

Price 10/10
--------
Probably best bang for your buck even after the complaints to performance. Will make calls when I need to and call quality is good. That should be most of the reason you need this phone. Uses google maps just fine and I have few problems running any single app. Not having a USB-C doesn't bother me, as most of my other devices are still the old USB standard. It's nice to be able to travel and use one type of cord for my PS4 controller, phone, and tablet again. I've never been caught in a bind because my phone takes 2 hours to fully charge instead of one. . .

Final Thoughts: I am not feeding into the phone consumerism nonsense, where it is now the norm to spend $600-1000 on a phone every 2-3 years. I hope Huawei can stick to releasing quality phones for under $400 in the U.S. I plan on using them for as long as I can.",Positif
"After two weeks of usage, i can say that dont go by the price tag. This phone can easily give competition to some flagship phones costing 4 or 5 times more. The phone looks premium and people often mistake it for galaxy phone. Battery easily goes for 2 days , camera is good and portrait mode also comes out good. Face Id works pretty well, and finger print is snappy. Love the way u can use the finger print to pull down notification bar or scroll through photos.
All in all, a great device for the price.",Positif
"Coming from iphone 6, this phone is simply amazing. Everything works smoothly after 2 months, and with Android Oreo recently updated is even better. A phone with face id at this price and all the functionality at this range of price is incredible, considering that I also have a micro SD of 128gb. No need to spend 1000 dollars for a phone.",Positif
Wouldn't recognize SIM Card. Sent it in for repair. 10 days later received the phone with a note. They refused to repair and honor the warranty because of the liquid damage. I have never dropped or put it in the water. Only took three pictures at a light raining day. All my friends' phone are fine at the same situation but mine.,Negatif
I was extremely disappointed as soon as I gave it to my daughter it fell and the screen cracked so bad I couldn't believe it. When I checked to see how much it cost to get fixed it was almost as much as the phone.,Negatif
"I was unlucky with the phone, it died completely after 2 days of purchase, I got it on a Sunday, die on Tuesday, suddenly, it won't start, searching on the net found some other people with the same problem, some after a week some after a month. Returning it to Amazon for refund. I may have gotten a lemon, but I won't be buying another Honor again.",Negatif
"I bought this phone off eBay brand new for 254 because at the time the Honour store and Amazon were both out of stock of the phone. Everything works well except the Bluetooth, I had to download a third party app from the play store in order to connect to my Bluetooth speaker, it will not connect to any Bluetooth devices using the software it comes with and that really sucks. Also when you are paired the WiFi slows down significantly.

Also the phone unlocks with the fingerprint sensor but can't be locked with it.",Positif
"There is a known hardware problem on this phone where the GPS receiver doesn't work. It simply will not connect to any satellites. Huawei knows this as do I and many other owners. I've been trying to work with customer service for weeks to resolve and no dice. They won't replace it even though the phone is under warranty and is eligible (their words).

I do not recommend.",Negatif
"For the two months that i had this phone, it worked ok, until it was updated with BND-L24 8.0.0.330(C567) and all my apps stopped working over cellular network, they only worked on WiFi. I had to reset the phone to the previous operating system for my apps to work again. This is very poor update from Huawei.",Negatif
"I ordered this phone for my sister, and within the time I opened up the box and pulled it out the new film and everything, It had scratches on the phone. I didn't buy this refurbished, I bought it new, so for there to be deep scratches on the front of the screen and new in a box was unacceptable. I returned it, and I'm ordering it again, for the last time, if I have the same issues, I will not be buying this phone.",Positif
"Great Phone sturdy and easy to use great features. camera and video quality are very good. features galore this phone does a lot. Great size screen clear display. Just cant under score the amount of features. Camera modes, low battery mode ,",Positif
"it's the best phone I have ever owned.Everything works well,fast and snappy ,excellent voice quality,duel rear cameras and the only Android phone I have ever had that I can get 2 days of battery life.What can I say,it's just a great phone and for under 200 bucks.",Positif
"I love this phone! I never wrote any reviews previously on anything I bought. But this phone is too good to ignore. I have it for a few months now, and it works really good. It's a great phone for a great price. I fell in love with the camera, I just wish the 'honor 7x' didn't show up on every picture I took. It's also hard to get a clear picture while in movement. Other than that, it is a really nice phone to have. I would totally recommend it!",Positif
I'm annoyed by the simple fact that nowhere in the description did it say it required nano sim card and now I have to wait a week to potentially two weeks for the earliest one to come in that I could find. That and now I have to transfer everything from my old phone manually which is also annoying and hey how great is it to finally have a new phone that I can't use anytime soon because of poor marketing? I could have ordered the sim card along with everything else. I'll change the review if/when I get the nano sim card and it actually works.,Negatif
"Very good Phone for the price, no major issues.
gets a bit slow after some months, but can be ignored for the price.
Camera was very good. And No it doesn't take actual Portraits as iPhone.",Positif
It should be stated in the product summary that this phone is not compatible with Verizon LTE in the US. Verizon does not support this phone.,Negatif
"This is an amazing phone, I had it for a week and accidentally dropped it down a 100 foot waterfall. I went to retrieve it and the phone still worked!! I was surprised because of the water and massive cracked screen, I'm still able to make phone calls and the audio still works!

I don't know how the warranty works but if I had the money Id buy it again! <3",Positif
"This phone is very nice looking and has a good camera, but the software is the low mark for me. Mine gets sluggish and does not perform as well as my other Moto G5 plus. Battery life is really good. I am waiting for when there Android 8.0 comes out for it, I was real disappointed it was running 7.0 not even 7.1.1 which gave it more features. Finger print reader works great and is in a good spot for me on the back, the Moto has it on the front. For $200.00 I don't think you can go wrong. P.S. If you have 5gz wifi it will not connect only 2.4gz.
Update:
Phone was very unresponsive, however I unchecked close power consuming apps and it is now working fine.",Positif
"Let me make something clear... This is ONLY compatible with a NANO sim card. So for all you out there with the typical micro or mini...your going to have to get it cut. I scoured through the reviews and QA's to make sure it was compatible with T-Mobile, and it is! BUT your gonna have to most likely cut the sim card. Good news is in my area Best Buy does it for free, it only took 2 minutes. But I love this phone!",Positif
"if you plan on using Android Auto with this phone don't bother with it. Phone is great otherwise and very fast and smooth with Android Oreo. However there are known issues with Huawei phones and Android Auto. The Huawei dialer does not work correctly with Android Auto- when someone calls no screen comes up you and you can't connect or disconnect a call. This has been a known issue and Google or Huawei is refusing to fix it. Only way to correct it is to side load some hacked google dialer apk to the X7. This is just unacceptable. The other issue is that Google Play music has no sound at all in Android Auto. This is also an issue with Huawei/Honor phones in general. All other music apps like Amazon Prime music and Spotify work fine, it's just Google Play music. The fix for that is to install a third party equalizer app and have it running when Android Auto starts. I travel a lot and both of these issues are big IMHO and the phone is not worth the effort to get AA to work. It seems both Google and Huawei have no concerns to get this fixed. There are facebook pages and twitter accounts dedicated to this issue- just do a Google search.",Positif
"I've been using this phone for a month and it's fantastic. Large, bright screen, fast-charging battery that holds a charge for 3 days with normal use (I don't typically game or stream movies), fast, and great looking. There's a good reason that Huawei just surpassed Apple as the 2nd largest manufacturer of smart phones in the world. Their phones are top notch.",Positif
"Short and sweet: looks and feels great, unlocks quickly.

But this phone can hardly handle a few low-intensity apps running in the background. The navigation buttons feel unresponsive and often don't listen to your input.

The camera takes a good few seconds to actually open up, and I'd you're stuck in the wrong orientation, flipping it around from selfie to front facing will take yet another few seconds. By that point, the opportunity is lost or your friends are fed up with you and your phone.

Flipping between apps by double tapping the square is always a clunky, rugged transition, with animations skipping several frames. Switching between keyboard languages is also clunky and slow-to-load.

Coming from an iPhone digital keyboard, the auto complete is a huge step back. Misspelling a word, having it auto complete to a correctly spelled word, but it's not quite the word you're looking for, so you backspace to tweak it a bit, only to have the word revert to the original misspelled word, is way more frustrating than I thought it could ever be.

These all seem like minor annoyances. They are. But when they're all working in unison it makes for a very frustrating experience.",Negatif
Great phone...,Positif
"The phone seemed okay when I bought it, as months passed by started showing it's true colors. It started slowing down, hanging etc. I have to give kudos to Amazon Customer Service for helping me with this purchase.",Negatif
Amazon's customer service is great. The phone is better than I expected. I am satisfied,Positif
"I got my and 4 of my boys on Huawei products ( two 7x and a 8) and all of them stopped functioning, including mine after the second month. screens stop functioning, unacceptable hard half minute stuttering, you name it. Not accceptable. find another product.",Negatif
"After a long time , i get a wonderful item from Amazon.com , Good to have these. i suggest these for who find a good one for reasonable rate.",Positif
I checked with the Huawei support and they confirmed that this phone will never support Wifi 5 Ghz. It's a big limitation for this kind of latest phone.,Positif
"I ordered this phone from the Honor website and I honestly loved the phone. It has a slim clean design, though a bit large. The camera was nice. I really appreciated the small things that was considered like a pedometer that I did not need to set up. They include the status of not only the phone battery but also the status of the bluetooth headphones battery. These are just two of the conveniences that I did not expect but appreciated. In the end, I had to return the phone because the apps continued to freeze up giving me a wait or quit app alert. This happened a lot when trying to use the camera. Then the EMUI would crash. To summarize, The Honor 7 was nice when it worked, but it would stop so regularly, that I could not sustain it. I reset the phone to factory settings but it still did not work. No updates seemed to help.",Negatif
very nice phone . working well,Positif
Ok if you don't need GPS. For some reason GPS worked the day I activated it then nothing. Wouldn't buy had I known,Positif
"Great the graphics are suitable for most games what people
Don’t understand is that they are giving this product 1 star because they expect this device to run like a Samsung Galaxy S8 and unfortunately your going to have to cough up $700-$1000 for a top notch phone it’s just the way it is it’s like using a sedan to haul a boat it’s not going to be very efficient if you use this to play causal games like temple run 2 clash of clans and Snapchat Facebook Instagram Twitter this is the phone for you if
You expect some great quality cámara and speakers your out of luck on this phone stop being cheap and go get yourself a galaxy S8 or a Google pixel also this is a great international phone it’s compatible all GSM carriers around the world and it’s Dual Sim so it’s a plus all this for just $200 (again if you want some top notch phone stop being a broke hoe and get a S8 or a Pixel)",Positif
"Excellent in all respects - battery life, camera, high tech, great value. I have to laugh at the Amazon trolls who put this amazing phone down!
Fake news.

I bought the red VD release after loving the Honor 8. Apple and Samsung, there's a new kid in town and he is good.",Positif
Amazing phone smooth operating system and great camera why spend mode when you can get more for less,Positif
I like the fingerprint scanner because it is fast and sreen is really big and good,Positif
Very happy with this phone.,Positif

Nice!,Positif
"on 2nd day we got the dreaded Headphone jack bug. Phone thinks there is a headset connected. they skimped out on quality around the headset area and it's causing massive probs all around. Its with the connections inside the phone, reset wont fix.",Negatif
With the Oreo update this phone is great..As good as phones 2-3 times its price....,Positif
"I am writing this review from using this phone as my personal one for a week.
I was really excited to try this phone out and maybe replace my iPhone se with it.
Here’s how it went.

The pros of the phone
1. The screen is huge, vibrant and beautiful. I am seriously impressed by it and the looks of the phones metal casing.
2. The finger print reader is amazingly fast and it so much better the iPhones by far. The placement of the scanner it perfect as well. Although, this phone doesn’t support android pay...how?
3. This is a half and half.
The cameras are nice but it’s kinda funny how this has an 8 mp camera compared to the iPhone se’s 2mp. Yet, the iPhone camera quality looks way better than any that this can take.

Annnnd that’s it for pros lol

Cons:

1 Camera: as I stated, all the hype not allot of preformance takes forever to try to get to the app and you can’t access it from the lock screen. You’ll always miss the shot.
2. Battery life: this phone drains extremely fast it’ll be dead before the day is over and that’s only light use. Occasionally texting and a couple calls.
3. GUI: the user interface is an awful experience making you go to extreme lengths to do the simplest tasks.
Very little shortcuts for cameras flashlights or screenshots. Basically all the things you need to do fast.
4. Maybe one of the worst things about this phone is the vibrating motor and notifications.
This phone always fails to show you that you have a text or a call.
No matter what you do it never shows anything in the lock screen.
You have to constantly check every single one of your apps to see if you have a new message. Example: Snapchat there is no notification and no badge app icon. You have to check the app frequently to see if you got one.
The vibrations motor, when it does go off, is the lightest feather-like vibration ever. You’ll never feel it.
So if you want everyone to hate you because you never reply...this phone is a good option.
5. Processor: the processor is really underpowered for what they are trying to make this phone do. Maybe this is what is causing all the other problems like short battery life (proccecor being overworked by its normal use).
From day one I had this phone freeze up at least twice a day. It’s very slow trying to run or send anything.
6. Speakers: the single down firing speaker is awful. The volume is very quiet for what you would expect from a phone this size. There is absolutely no bass and from an equalizer standpoint the sound it flat.
7. Micro USB port: seriously?
Micro not even USB type C? Not only that it is designed incorrectly so when you plug in a charger to it the cord will just fall out with the force of gravity on the cord. (Very fun to wake up to a phone with 3%).
Also, it doesn’t support fast charging.
8. Honor? Okay this phone and it’s software is basically an iPhone 7 ripoff. Literally everything. Even the settings menu is made to look identical. To think they named this phone “honor” with the absolute lack of it.
9. Hacking.
Very angry about this and it was the point in which I sent it back immediately.
When you take a photo it provides a location of where it’s taken.
Well when I started taking photos. Every once in awhile my phone would show that my photo was taken in China. China? I was in the U.S. not China.
So my photos are being sent to China and that’s the last of that phone.
I’ll upload the screenshot of the proof of this.",Negatif
"Update 04-08-2018: I've had the phone for over a month now and it's still great. Every few days I have to reboot it because it does seem to slow down...but rebooting a phone every 5 days it's a problem to me at all. It does charge slowly, but again, not an issue for me. Plugging it in at 10% easily gets to 100% overnight. The battery life is still amazing. I use it heavily throughout the day and it's still at 50% or more by the time I go to bed. Typically I charge it every two days or maybe top it off a little bit if needed.

I had an Axon 7 (which I absolutely loved) but the battery would only last a few hours so decided it was time for a new phone. I couldn't find anything with the nice specs of my Axon 7 so decided to settle for this phone until something better came along. I was totally shocked how good this phone is. It totally buries my Axon 7 on boot up and is very responsive. I didn't particularly care for the UI so replaced it with Nova launcher. I was a bit worried whether it would work correctly because other reviewers said they had problems getting it to work. I had no issues at all. I use T-Mobile and MMS wouldn't work at all the first day, but by the next day it was working...not sure what's up with that (I'm using Textra).

The phone does lack a few things that would be nice, but they are absolutely not deal breakers. USB-C would have been nice, but I have a ton of the old cables, so that's not a problem. An IR blaster would be nice, but to be honest I haven't really used those on my old phones and they had them.

My biggest gripe at this point might be the sound. It's ok, but nothing special at all. Perhaps it's because I was spoiled by the Axon 7, but I'd rather have a phone with a mediocre speaker than one I had to charge 3 times a day.

The battery life is amazing. I started off the day with 67% charged. I listened to an audio book to and from work (40 minute commute each way), had waze on for 40 minutes, made a few phone calls and listened to music all day...about 8 hours (screen off). By the time I got home the charge was down to 45%!! This beats the heck out of any other phone I had and used this much. The phone looks and feels great...it doesn't feel like I only spent $199 on it.

The great part is watching others go spend $1000 on a new iPhone and realize that my 7x is just as functional and I could have 5 of them.",Positif
"Had this phone for just over a week now and I can honestly say that I have zero complaints. It does exactly what I wanted and then some. I was previously using ""BLU"" phones and after quite a bit of researched decided to switch over. Where as my BLU phone was sluggish and laggy this phone is fast and takes almost no time to load anything I ask of it. I also really really love the double screen feature it has. The camera could be better, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons for this gem.",Positif
"Purchased this phone to replace my father's outdated SS Note 3, and he is quite happy with the upgrade. I've been an iPhone guy since the 3G back in 2008. I have to say this phone has sincerely WOW'd me for the price. I've looked up reviews and knew I was expecting a similar design to my current iPhone 7+, but for $200 I can say the display's quality is similar to my iPhone 7+, the build quality feels similar of an iPhone, the buttons for volume and lock are clicky and satisfying to press and overall better than my iPhone's buttons! (and Honor includes a FREE CLEAR CASE in box vs headphones which has more value to me imo) UMEI is a great skin, it is very iOS-like which felt very familiar out of the box, and great to have the app drawer enabled by default. Seriously the only drawback I can think of is the camera quality, for a dual lens system I was expecting a little more sharpness and color reproduction but I noticed most photos, were lacking in light/color. It gets the job done, but I highly recommend Honor/Huawei to spend the extra $ on their next model and increase the msrp by $20 to include an improved camera module and this would easily replace my iPhone next year. NO NFC so no Android Pay, but my father is very old school and could care less about it, but it could be a dealbreaker for those who frequent contactless payments. But most modern credit/debit cards are going contactless, so there's that. Anyways thanks for creating a great phone for the price Huawei you knocked it out of the park in almost every department in my book.",Positif
"Bought this phone because this was the best bang for my buck. I don't have a lot of disposable income, so when I am buying a phone it has to tick the necessary boxes for me at the great price.
- Great build quality (if all goes well may be using it for 3 years plus)
- Updated to Android Oreo (not Android P but its as close to being updated as it gets without having a Google or android one phone
- Decent Battery
- Decent Camera
- 32 GB internal memory(any less is a deal breaker)
- headphone jack (another deal breaker)
- expandable memory
So it ticked the above boxes and many others, it's by no means super fast and I have noticed that there are some hiccups in usage but nothing too annoying.
Overall, it great package.",Positif
"If you want to have some cheap fun, just read reviews. Reviews of any product. Amazing. Some say it was sent from above. Some say it absolutely sucks. How can it be so opposite? Funny. The truth i think lies somewhere in the middle. I like more about the phone then i don't like about the phone. i am comparing to other phones in the same basic price range i have compared it to. Of course, this is only my personal opinion like all other reviews...

The likes and don't likes:

- I like: That it is because it has little bloat wear.
- I like: That because it is totally unlocked it works with virtually ALL phone services AND even in Europe.
- I like: The strong processor for only 199.99.
- I like: The overall quality of the phone.
- I like: The loud, clear, phone reception when speaking with someone.
- I like: The camera. Not great, but for 199.99 it is great. If it was an 800.00 phone i may give it less stars.
- I like: It is fluid and smooth when using it. The screen scrolls well, i have NEVER had it freeze as some reviews say.
- I like: As other reviews state, it is just a great phone for under 200.00. I have seen some phones that are new like this one that are dogs in comparison for the same price. After using it you would believe you have a much more expensive phone then it is.
- I like: The big screen. NICE screen too....
- I like: There are other things I like also about the phone, but will end it here..

- I don't like so much: I feel like i am getting real picky here, but i have to come up with some negative. I didn't care for the onboard email app. and text app. I found a couple of third party apps that seem to work well, so i am using those.
- I don't like so much: The fact there is no fast charging USB port.
- I don't like so much: That there are a couple of software 'leave-out's' that could be mentioned, but not worth the effort to post. Piddly little things i think for under 200.00. If it was 600.00 it would be worth the complaint.

I am going to SHOCK many people who read this review.................. I bought the phone................. TO BE A PHONE. I want to call someone and have the call quality be GOOD. The first time i used the phone my son called me who was on a business trip across the U.S. from where i am. The call was so loud and clear it was as though he was standing a few feet from me. Amazing. If I want to text someone I want it to work good. If I want to email someone I want it to work good. I want to be able to take a decent photo now and then. I could give a rats rear end whether i can play a video game. I will use my X-Box if i want to do that. IF i want to take professional pictures i will use my ""Camera"" for that. I want a phone to be a PHONE first and foremost. I occasionally have need to Google something when i am out and about. I want it to not crap out on me while i am in a browser. I want the processor to power through and not die on me and the phone freeze while trying to surf some website. This one has been super in that regard. From that standpoint this phone works GREAT. All the other goodies are all pluses...

So the overall review for me is that phone, for the price deserves 5 stars. How could i NOT give it 5 stars? it is a great phone for 200 bucks. Unbelievable really. That is why it is so highly rated. Do the math. It has much more in features then not. Did i mention it is just plain outright good looking phone too. I love how the processor powers through everything i have thrown at it most of all.....

FOOTNOTE:

This is a foot note my first review above. I have had the phone for over a month and it has worked just super. Happy with it as can be other then the negatives i gave it, which really were not negatives at all. Something i found out that worked for me regarding the BATTERY not holding up as advertised. I bought the phone with ""Nougat 7.0."" I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers that said they found that before you do anything, you immediately install the 8.0 upgrade. THEN after doing the upgrade IMMEDIATELY do one more reset of the phone.

I found that initially my battery did not seem to hold up well as i expected. I was a little disappointed. I did as one reviewer suggested and reset my phone one more time. I noticed a REAL difference how the battery performed. No doubt about it. It made a real difference. 1. IF you buy the phone new do the update FIRST THING. Before doing anything. IF you have had the phone for a while, still do the reset. 2. RESET the phone AFTER the update. Made a difference for me just as the reviewer suggested...",Positif
"At the beginning a five stars phone. It's nice; well designed, but one month later everything it's changing. The camera takes a long time to open. Sometimes the touch screen does not respond. The pictures quality's are not like a 16 mp camera. The Bluetooth connection works but I lose the connection with my smartwatch each 15 or less minutes. If I turn off the Bluetooth or the phone I can not reconect again the watch. I have to start pairing again and again several times. I do not recommend this phone. It's a nice face but it's like cheap Chinese phone.. Try Nokia; Samsung or other brands. I am sorry for my English.
Updating may 25: due problems with the bright I tried to send the phone to the warranty center. I had to call them about seven times and took them six days to send me a simple email with the return label shipping. I decided do not send because they do not like very serious . I do not recommend to buy this phone. The phone is good but if you need use the warranty you are going to find is not easy",Negatif
"I have been using it for quite a bit now and I absolutely LOVE it! My phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy S5 and I had has all the previous ones of that so I was a little nervous to go with a different kind of phone. To be honest, I like it even better! The picture quality could be better but it's not bad for everyday use! It's better than the S5 for sure, more comparable to the S4 which I loved as well.
I haven't had any issues with the phone as of yet! There is a ton of memory which is good for me because I take a TON of pictures! Internet capability is great and I have no issues! It does have a google keyboard and is google-based, which I do not mind. I would definitely buy this again, best money I have spent on a phone yet!",Positif
"I am using honor 7x from last 7 days. I am very satisfied after using this. I was using samsung galaxy j7 prime, but suddenly it's mother board crashed. It was asking for $150 to replace that, I was searching all the way and came across about honor 7x. At first I was bit hesitant, after reading reviews I purchased this, with $200, it is really a flagship phone. Camera quality is pretty good both front and back. It has finger sensor, face sensor, pattern match, security lock code. It is very sleek mode, pretty first as per performance, very good looking, touch screen is very sensitive which I personally like very much. Even I installee 2 3 games and it did not degrade any performance.
Though some of the features has some challenges like it does not have oled display which we can bear without that,
It doesnot contain snapdragon, battery charging is not fast. But battery stays long with this phone.
So for overall honor 7x is a hit model according to me and it is really worth to have a phone like this in this money.",Positif
"Screen: The screen is bright and colorful, but I think it's LCD and not IPS as the viewing angles aren't the best, but even then it looks fine.

Camera: The default camera app is trash. I downloaded HedgeCam2 and activated Camera2 API and some advanced options like saving in RAW. In this mode, the pictures are really sharp and clear after editing them in Lightroom Mobile (Snapseed works well too). It makes the pics taken in the default app look like they were taken with a potato, especially in low light conditions. I really recommend taking your time to do this as the phone takes better pictures that you may realize at first glance.

The Dual Camera is a joke as it doesn't look that good, the blurry part looks more like it's 5 Mpix than 16. Honestly, it's just there for marketing, like in most budget phones, but if you're into blurry effects on your selfies, I guess you can get some use out of it.

Video: Limited to 1080p by the default camera app, you can go a bit higher with an app like HedgeCam2 (2048x1080 or 2K).

Speed: Seems fluid so far, but that's because it's new. I will update this review as it gets slower (or not) after some use.

Customization: This phone comes with EMUI and I'm not a fan of it, but it works well. Hopefully, future updates will make it better.

The main things you look for in a phone these days: Screen, camera, speed, stability. All of it is fine on this phone and for 200$ that's great, the camera is a win if you take your time to learn how to get the most out of it.

P.D: This is not my phone, it's my sister's, but I tested it just like if it were mine.",Positif
"So far so good. It booted fine, ran through the setup and got me logged into Google. The expected bloatware was there naturally but I was surprised to be able to uninstall a lot of it. It came with Android 7.0, but 8 was available for immediate download. One thing I'm really liking is the fingerprint sensor. It's on the back where your index finger naturally finds it and unlocking the phone that way is very fast and easy. The only hitch I had was my old sim is a micro sim and this phone requires a nano sim. I'll have to go to the Cricket store and get a new one.

Edit: The Oreo and GUI download went just swimmingly and Cricket was glad to charge me $10.50 for a SIM card. One thing I can't get working though is the notification LED. It works when charging, but I can't get it to flash for any notifications. I Googled the problem and one solution was to wipe the cache partition. That didn't work, although I did get a bunch of texts that hadn't come through before. Today I did a factory reset and that didn't work either. It's in the software someplace. Maybe they'll fix it with an update at some point.

Edit 2: Apparently the Notification LED only works with the screen off. I got red, blue, and green to work with Chomp.

Edit 3. I get much better reception with this phone than I did with my LG-G4. Usually 1 to 2 bars better in fringe areas.",Positif
"This is a GREAT Android device for the price. We were hesitant as the on line reviews trashed the camera, but that's just NOT true. This camera is great. Takes nice NORMAL pictures. We are not too interested in taking photos in the dark, or underwater... just nice family event photos. This one excels at everything. Great screen, good looks, fast processor and a fast fingerprint scanner to unlock the device.
The ONLY thing that MAY be a deal breaker for some is the lack of NFC. Google Pay won't work here.
It also is a dual sim phone but we elected to put in a 128GB Micro SD card into that slot. This, together with the 32 GB on board, gives us a total of 160 GB of storage.
No dumb ""Bloatware"" either... almost a pure android OS that we came to love over some manufacturer's ""skins"" that do nothing more than duplicate what Google has already done... and done much better too.
Friends have already mistaken it for a new ""Something, Something 9"" phone that costs $500. more.
Nope.... and we are very happy that it is what it is.",Positif
"First of all build quality is on par with flagships. Fingerprint reader works great, screen is great and visible in direct sunlight. Battery holds up all day with plenty to spare with non gaming use and the processor is fast. The camera is excellent, it works well in low light and the dual cameras bokeh effect is spot-on. Zero regrets with this purchase.",Positif
"I bought this as a prime deal and paid $166 for it. This outperforms my old iPhone 5C in nearly every way. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the slow charging battery and the less than ideal sound quality. When you use the aux Port with headphones the sound quality is reeeeeally bad, even with the best quality headphones. It sounds like an old radio. No bass, and no fullness to the sound. But even though the battery charged slowly it is very long lasting. I would say this is a solid 4/5 star product.

The photos are clear, selfies mode has a built in beauty filter that evens your skin tone and such. There's a fingerprint unlock feature on the back of the phonr, very cool. I love the blue color, and the screen is huge. Also, as a bonus, the box included a clear silicone case and a lanyard. I still got a separate case for it anyway, but it's great that they included that.
I highly recommend this product. But be sure to buy a case and screen protector.",Positif
"Just arrived - review might change after some use. But, first impressions are that this is a very nice, near flagship quality phone. In the past, I've had Samsungs, Xiaomis, a variety of off-brand (in the US market, at least) phones like Cubot, etc... and this is the only phone I've used so far that seems to rival the 2nd gen Xiaomi that I was using a few years ago.

I promised myself after my last phone (a vendor-locked Samsung Galaxy S7) that I would never again purchase a US market phone, nor a Korean branded phone - I have no idea how most Americans tolerate the crap Samsung & their telecom cronies sell. I am not disappointed in this decision.

FYI: I live in the US (rural New England) and get adequate 4G LTE service via AT&T. Any issues with connectivity are - as I know from much experience - AT&T's fault, not any manufacturer. However, service overall is 10x better with an unlocked phone. You'll be sorry if you put that SIM into a US-market retail phone from AT&T!!! Buy unlocked!",Positif
"The phone was ok. I have mostly used high spec flagship phones but I needed a phone in a pinch but this want what I wanted. There was quite a few things to like about this phone, like the finger print reader on the back which is super fast and accurate. The screen brightness was good fit a lower end phone.
But just after a few days the phone started to feel laggy. I don't much care for the EMUI skin that Huawei puts on top of Android. I feel like this may have been one of the reasons for the lag. I bought another phone that was cheaper with no skin on top of Android Avd they was running Android 8.0 Avd ir Geely like it ran another then this one. I have since passed out in to my daughter but she still is quite enjoying that phone.",Positif
This is a wonderful phone. I'm a tech person and the phone works flawlessly with big ram the screen is very beautiful and big the battery is very large last me about whole day. Definitely would buy a again,Positif
"This is the absolute best phone at the current price mark. If you like multitasking however, depending on the apps you are using, you might have some issues with speed. I used a remote desktop app to control numerous computers while on the phone, and noticed significant lagging. However most phones would be much slower under that kind of workload. For the everyday user, this phone is an amazing buy. Do not listen to people when they say that this phone does not take good pictures and video. Out of the box, it is great for pics and vids. There are plenty of apps that can take the camera to higher levels of quality as well. The only thing I do not like about having this phone is.....Huawei does not issue updates quickly or consistently for the US version of this phone. All other versions seem to get updates, but not the United States version. Outside of this small issue, the phone is a must buy for anyone on a budget. Huawei has the potential to take over the US market, provided our government allows them to make deals with the major phone carriers. Go ahead if you are thinking about this......and buy this phone. You will love it!",Positif
"This phone is perfect for the price. When you first turn it on, the screen will catch you by surprise because it'll look really damn weird, but you'll get used to it and after you get used to it, it'll look pretty freaking awesome. Performance is nice and I've only noticed occasional hiccups when I use snapchat and Facebook messenger at the same time. Not a problem. The camera leaves something to be desired and I honestly think they slapped the second camera on to be able to say it has a dual camera... You can get much better pictures with phones that have one camera but it still gets the job done... It's better than most in the price range but I think the ZTE Axon Mini's camera has it beat. (and it's cheaper)",Positif
"I have Cricket and after being through several of their phones in four months, I figured I had nothing left to lose.

This thing is great!! It downloaded my 3 banking apps, credit card app, credit karma, Facebook, messenger, and pages all under six minutes. The UI is quite pleasant, as is all of the customization you can do to the phone itself. It's speedy and efficient, and feels like an expensive phone.

No wonder Huawei is so big in Europe and India.

UPDATE:
After a month of heavy use I still enjoy this phone. It can be a little laggy and get hot if I'm running too many apps. I am pleased to say that it isn't glitchy often at all; it has only froze on me once.
No dropped call complaints, and everything is clear and still running well.

UPDATE: Here we are, April 4th and my Bluetooth doesn't work. The phone has been in a case and screen protector since day one. It's a huge shame I need Bluetooth for my business and after less than three full months of use a critical part of something for me is now broken.",Negatif
"Phone purchased on July 12th, Recieved on July 19th. And stated to use it on July 27th. It is indeed a nice little budget phone which provides what you need to get going. No it doesnt compare to the super exensive phones, but it holds its own.

The main issues I am having with it though is
1)the switch from wifi to mobile data. If I dont restart it, it will no longer go on mobile data once I take it off wifi. And even after restarting it, it takes a bit of patience not to get pissed off while it takes its time to adjust to mobile data.
2) and sometimes after ending a call, again I must restart to get my mobile data going.

So 2 stars out fot that.",Positif
"I had this phone for only seven months and used to love it! The battery life was awesome and most of the functions worked as well as the more pricey phones. I bought 2 of these in June and they both started to malfunction. The one did not charge at all anymore, and sadly this phone has no built in wireless charging capabilities. I sent it to the manufacturer since it was still under warranty. They immediately sent it back stating there was liquid damage and they would not cover it. I really don't think they had it long enough to even look at it as it came back to me within the week. I feel they just don't want to stand by their warranty. The second phone was just shipped to them yesterday, as that one is having a battery problem as well and wont charge anymore. I would stay away from Honor phones and maybe steer clear of Huawei products as well, I feel they will just use an excuse to not repair your phone. The batteries should last a lot longer than 7 months.",Negatif
"Love the phone but a lot of times it doesn't pick up my touch. I have the 6x and it recognizes my touch just fine. So it's very frustrating when I'm typing and it skips letters due to it not picking up the touch and also with the main screen buttons. I don't know if I have a faulty device or of this is a common issue. other than that it's a good phone.

Update.
Have removed the screen protector and so far it's doing good. Will update again if I have any problems.",Positif
"Waiting on support. Fingerprint sensor doesn't seem to work. More after i resolve that. Other than that this seems like a solid smart phone at a reasonable price. OK.. THE INSTRUCTIONS are wrong on the fingerprint sensor.. no ""vibrate"" . you smoosh your finger around the sensor until the little ""icon"" is filled then a message to touch your finger on the edge pops up.. so the sensor worked.. the set up is written wrong. Amazon support doesn't know this and Huawei has iffy support for Honor Phones as far as I can tell. The phone is great.. Machined aluminum case and gorilla glass.. tough..minimum bloatwear.. good size.. not too big like a ""phablet"" fits into a hand nce.. fits into pockets. great display. better than the ASUS this replaces.. The ASUS was OK.. too many annoying bugs (camera was slow.. like ketchup that won't come out of a bottle. I think this will be a very good phone, purchased on PRIME day at a very competitive price.",Positif
"This is my first android. I've had an iphone since they came out and I'm coming from a 5C to this 7x. I've had it for about 24 hours now and wow! For 200 bucks you couldn't get a better phone. The screen is huge and beautiful. This definitely isn't a 1 handed phone. I'm not a big gamer at all just some pokemon go. Android took some getting used to at first but I love this phone. My only gripe is the very very limited selection in cases (it does come with a flimsy clear one) but that's the price you pay for a cheap phone. Really though, nothing about this phone seems cheap. I threw on the IQ matte shield for the screen and if you can get phones like this for 200 bucks why would you ever pay 500+ again?",Positif
"I love this phone. It is big enough, has fantastic features, takes great pictures, and great connection to my service 4LTE. I personally think paying $1000 for a phone is not cost effective when you can get something that does pretty much the same thing. It had face recognition before many of the""great"" companies and it works great. The fingerprint recognition is also very good but takes some time to set up and memorize your fingerprint, but, nonetheless, I did fingers on both hands. Updated to Oreo right away and it just works great. I will say I am not a ""power"" user, I text and make calls, use the net once in a while.........so the power for me is great lasts 3 days. All the apps open quickly and run well. No big glitches. SO if you was an almost 6 inch phone, that is fast, takes pretty pictures, great sound, smooth and easy screen, and has decent battery power, this may be for you. I think it is great! Reviews on this phone rate it the best for what you get.",Positif
"They said it will release on Jan 25 when i pre-order it in Dec last year, but I got it Jan 24. this is the best smart phone I have ever had. for the price and quality, it is nothing to compain about.
Some useful info.:
1. this phone came with a clear rubber case, so if you are not really care about the personality, the case is quite good.
2, there is curve on either side, so if you buy the screen protector, it may not easy to install.
3. it only support NANO sim card, NOT the micro sim card, so i need to change to a new card.
4. use the small pin provided to push out the side slot for SIM and microSD card.
5. support Daul sim card",Positif
"This is an awesome phone!!! The price is amazingly low for a high quality device. Performance is great and very fast. Connection to LTE is great as well too. And the screen looks very good. I don't game so i couldn't tell you how it does, but browsing, watching videos, and normal phone functions work flawlessly. This is the best phone in its category for the price by far.",Positif
It's a good phone! It doesn't feel cheap it's not really lightweight. I got the blue colored phone.. On the photo it looks lighter blue but it's not its darker in person. The screen is crisp and vibrant. The photos are too. But the videos are crisp not really clear and the audio isn't clear. That's why I gave it a 4 star the audio in videos aren't the best quality. Other than that I haven't had any lags or issues with the phone. Loving it =),Positif
"UPDATE (3/13/18) - After reluctantly returning to my iPhone 6s, I found the Huawei Mate SE. It has snappy performance and is a better fit for me. My iPhone has been officially retired.

UPDATE (2/23/18) - Like this phone in so many ways but the laggy performance has convinced me to return it and keep looking.

I've used some version of the iPhone for the past 10 years and never thought I'd switch, but the pricing of flagship models has become ridiculous. After reading several reviews of the Honor 7X, I took the plunge and am so happy I did. I'm definitely not an Android expert nor a power user, but the learning curve has been relatively painless and now that I've got everything set up, I couldn't be happier with my choice. The phone is well built and performs great in every way for my needs. I feel really good about choosing this brand and model... for me, it's perfect.",Positif
"For the price, this phone is an excellent performer. Seems really fast, the screen is crystal clear, with very nice colors. The battery life is excellent. It only loses 2% on standby over the span of 11 hours at night. sound quality is good, pictures taken with the camera look very good. Comes with a TPU clear cover which is ok. I replaced a Moto G5Plus with this and this phone in my opinion is a better phone.",Positif
"Here’s what I like about this phone:
1) Fingerprint reader - Awesome! It unlocks the phone instantly. Love this feature.
2) The metal casing and heft of the phone feel great on the hand.
3) The 16:9 screen is vibrant and pleasant to the eye.
4) The 16 MP camera - Takes great pictures ( see picture taken with phone)
5) Excellent battery life - I’ve been using it to watch videos, Pandora, taking photos, texting and the battery lasts for more than 1 day.

Here are features I wish it had:
1) Fast charging - Although not a deal breaker but nice to have.
2) OLED screen - Perhaps is too much to ask but it would be a nice feature.

At this price point, the phone is a great value for the features it has. I would definitely recommend this phone.",Positif
"Just got it today, play with it a little bit,I think it is amazing phone",Positif
"I would give it more stars if I could. I am not a phone expert. I use Tracfone and have purchased unlocked smart phones from Amazon. This phone is awesome. The camera (which was one of my primary concerns) is also awesome for my purposes. It was super easy to unlock and transfer all my remaining minutes/texts/data through Tracfone. I paid $199.00 for it using the six months interest free with my Amazon card. I never thought I'd pay that much for a phone....but, it's so much more than a phone. If I could manage Quicken on it, I'd get rid of my crappy laptop.",Positif
"I was getting this as a second phone and so I could have an android phone again as a side kick to my iPhone. I am in IT and like having both worlds for my job. The price is perfect and I really wanted to keep it! However I had a few issues with it so I sent it back. There was an issue with the olaphobic coating in the top right corner while made smudges that never went away! I also had other issues with the screen, colors, turning off when it wasn’t supposed too, etc. I am hoping this was a fluke issue with my device but one I couldn’t deal with!",Positif
"For $200, you get a lot of power. The phone is fast, has great battery life (I usually get around 2 days from one charge). Phone is unlocked out of the box so you can use it on a variety of GSM carriers (I use Cricket).

I've only had it for a few months but so far I am very impressed with this thing. I've had other budget phones where it just dies a horrible death within months (I upgraded from the BLU RD1 HD, which lasted me only 8 months before it became unusable). If you are looking for a great performer on a budget, this is a great choice.

The only things that I would gripe about (and they are really minor issues for me) are...

1. Setting wallpapers is weird. The image you pick will get LARGE, so if want a picture of your family, a kid, a pet, etc....a lot of times it will get cut off on the screen due to the warped size. Not a huge deal if you just have a generic graphic that you use.

2. Fitbits WILL NOT WORK with this phone. They are not a formally supported device. My wife has an Honor 6X and has the same issue with hers. Definitely a deal breaker if you rely on a FitBit for fitness tracking.

3. Some apps will not appear as notifications on the lock screen, but will appear in the taskbar when you unlock the phone.

The fitbit issue will be a dealbreaker for some folks but if you just want a phone that works fast, well, and doesn't break the bank....definitely give this phone a shot.",Positif
"Everyone thinks it's an iPhone when i have the case off. It's truly a beautiful phone with premium like quality. It takes amazing pictures which is what I use it for the most. One thing that'll take a while to get used to is the navigation panel being backwards for me. I'm used to the back buttons being on the right, but it won't be a problem after a few months of using the phone. Just wished they offered an option to switch the navigation around like in the new version of this phone.",Positif
"Great phone for the price! It's super quick, I can use multiple apps at once and there isn't any bloatware on this phone. One annoying thing is that it keeps telling me when an app is using a lot of energy (like Pokemon Go), but I got this phone for playing games on. The pictures it takes are breathtaking and I love the dual camera because I can focus on the foreground or background for taking professional looking pics. I had a Blu Vivo XL2 that lasted 1 year before it broke, so I hope Honor 7X can outlive my last phone.",Positif
"For $200 there is no better phone out there! Everything about this phone is outstanding, except for the sound. Speakers could be a little better but that's the only drawback. If the speakers are a deal breaker, look elsewhere. If your just looking for a not only great budge phone, but legitimately good phone period, this is for you! It even came with it's own phone case and it's actually really nice.
UODATE: this phone really gives you the Galaxy S8/S9 feel for a quarter of the price.",Positif
"Nice phone for this level of price. The set up is very easy and the screen is so big. I love it. I had a T-Mobile SIM card and everything is working fine. Perhaps the camera can be improved but again, it is a 200 use phone, so it is fine for me.
I recommend this phone to whoever does not want to spend 1000 use for an I phone or Samsung",Positif
"First time buying unlocked phone so I was super nervous. Shipped fast; OEM packaging as far as I can tell. Sleek phone; great performance so far. Camera is fun to use; not so great in low light so use flash. Still; portrait mode is gorgeous on both cameras. Haven't had a hiccup upgrading to Android 8 and works great with metro/TMobile service.
TLDR: fancy on a budget; works great",Positif
"I have been using the iPhone since the beginning. I have never owned an Android device so I can’t compare it to others. I even have the iPhone X. The reason I purchased this was I wanted a phone with dual sims. I hate carrying around two devices. I did a lot of research and wanted a good value. This phone fit the bill.
It will work with any gsm network. T-Mobile, AT&T and other prepaid gsm providers in the US.
Pros-
Fingerprint sensor is lighting fast!
Camera is pretty good.
Screen looks great
The phone is pretty snappy as far as speed. No real lag. I am using the stock software and from what I have read installing different launchers can slow it down.

Cons-
No 5ghz WiFi.
No fast charge, it takes a long time to fully charge.
No wifi calling
Second sim only 2G, you can still text but I don’t know if it can handle picture messages on 2G
No native mail app. You must use a third party mail app. Yahoo, google.
I think it has some form of ad software installed.
The usb connection to most new car radios does not allow you to play music or streaming apps from the phone. That can only be done with Bluetooth. This might just be an Android thing and not a phone thing. My iPhones have always worked with the usb connection.

Android messages.. this is by far the worst feature of an Android phone. There is no comparison to iMessage on the iPhone. It has limited features and a character limit.. seriously? Its 2018 and text are limited to 160 characters ??. If you are a heavy texter which I am not, Android isn’t for you if you are coming from an iPhone.
I guess some of my review is about the Android 7 OS. ??
I feel like I am using Windoze again. It’s not too bad but If you are tech savvy you can figure it out.
I’ll keep using it for a couple of weeks and if my opinion changes I’ll update my review.

If you are looking for a good value then this is the phone for you. For $200, you can’t go wrong.

UPDATE..

Well, I spoke to soon.. I am returning the phone.
It is now locking up. I have to constantly reboot it, I have had to reset it and when I install a few apps it starts happening again. I am guessing it’s the Android OS that is the problem but.. if the OS won’t run correctly it doesn’t matter how good the hardware is.
I am not a gamer or a frequent texter.. I do use a few social media apps and shopping apps, that’s about it..
still a good value if you can deal with the android OS.",Positif
"We bought 2 of these and took them to the T-Mobile store, where a very nice woman activated them and transferred all our apps and data for us. It was important for my husband to have a magnetometer, which this phone does. The battery (after 4 days) seems to last a long time. Will get back to you if we have any changes, but so far we are very happy we bought these. Our previous (unlocked) phones were Amazon special deals, and they had so much bloatware that the phones became almost impossible to use. It was important to us to find an unlocked phone with little bloatware and a lot of storage space.",Positif
Had it about 2 months when it slipped out of my pouch and plopped into the slippery rock river. I slid down the bank after it and bunged my shoulder. It then took me 10 minutes to find it fish it out. It had self-powered down but showed no obvious signs of water penetration. I buried it in a bag of rice for a night and plugged it in the next morning and it fired right up. This is a grand phone for the money. I have never owned any flagships but my wife has always owned a newer iphone. I like this one better in overall design irregardless of the price. Upgrade to Oreo happened the day I received it.,Positif
"Some of the software isn't made for the USA
Voice typing quit working by itself one day, even a factory reset didn't fix this problem.

"Combines a bunch of the newest features in the market and functions wonderfully. Works with Straight talk BYOP,",Positif
"I have been loving my Honor 7x so far :) It arrived quicker than expected, the phone came with its charger and a clear case.

For a budget phone, I am happy with its specs. I like both cameras, the phone is fast, specially its sensor for unlocking.

And the battery so far is great. I am a mid to heavy user, and it has lasted 1 day perfectly.

If I watch a 2 hour movie, it only takes off like 20% from the battery, which I think is great.

I have watched two movies so far with the same performance. Around 20%-25% of battery use.

The only cons I have found after a few weeks of use is the fact that the phone lags a bit when using the camera, specially switching from rear & front camera.

I don't know if it's a bug, but for the price I paid, I am a happy user!",Positif
"wow where should i start sure my galaxy not 8 is a beast, but this phone is sexy and beautiful. I wanted the blue one sold out twice im still gonna buy it from Huwaei if i have to they offer a swag bag deal tripod special case, so ill wait n see if Amazon gets the blue one back. Screen size is awesome speed is fast dual sim use one for a 256 gig sd card from samsung overall this is the best deal i hope Amazon gets the red valentines day edition when it comes out. great buy go out and buy this phone oreo 8.0 is out real soon so great deal.This is an update the screen lags a bit when scrolling up or down in apps hope this is fixed soon.",Positif
"So far so good, I have no complain and I guess for the money is not too bad. This phone has a much better screen glass compared to others low badge smartphone. The phone responded pretty fast and the battery is one of the kind probably the best feature in this mobile phone. In fact, everything functioned as should be. And like I said before for the price it is a good toy. An update, the phone is still working perfectly with the new EMUI 8.0.0 Android version...The speaker is another great feature it can be heard 150 ft away inside my house. Good phone for the price, I'm impress.",Positif
This is the second Honor phone my wife has had and she loves it. She dropped her last one and cracked the screen because she didn't have a protective case on it. She got many years of use out of it before this happened. We just decided to buy her a new one for $200.00 instead of having her screen replaced on the one she dropped. You can't go wrong with this phone purchase.,Positif
"I bought my husband this phone to replace his Samsung S6. He dropped his Samsung one time and after that the screen would flash on and off especially when the battery got low. I refused to pay another $800 for a phone and the reviews on this phone were great. So far my husband loves it, especially the battery life which he says is awesome. He can watch videos and play on his phone all day and not need to charge it. His Samsung wouldn't last even half the day. It is definitely competitive/comparable with these overpriced iPhones and Samsung phones.",Positif
"I've owned the Honor 6x in the past, and since it worked for me I was pretty confident the 7x would be no different. With prices of phones getting higher and higher I was looking for something that wasn't so expensive; I'd just returned the Mate 10 Pro for this very reason and decided to stick with Honor/Huawei.

I love that it gets VoLTE on my carrier (T-mobile), and that it includes a case in the box - definitely something other phone companies need to do. The handfeel is a HUGE improvement over the 6x, and though it's not what the market considers premium (glass) I like that if I went without a case the device would probably be ok too.

So far battery life has been about what my 6x was able to do, and for my usage/needs that's more than enough - I can get through a day in with 60% remaining, and that suites me just fine. I'm not a gamer, my apps are mostly time killers/utility apps, but I haven't had the device slow when switching or freeze while trying to load something.

EMUI isn't something that's a deal breaker for me, in fact I love that it has features that I sometimes have to unlock with an app or ADB on other devices (night mode, fingerprint scanner gestures, mobile hotspot toggle, data toggle, etc); about the only thing I wish it would include is the ability to load customer icons and/or make the default icons smaller.

Overall for what I paid for the phone I'm extremely satisfied right now, even if it does get an Android 8.0 update I'll still consider this money well spent as the feature set is pretty killer. There's some good competition in this space, so definitely look around but I'm happy with my purchase.",Positif
"I never give 5 stars, but again the Honor line has left me astounded. I LOVED my Honor 6x...but after a year in my back pocket, it had like a 10° bow in the frame and glass. Never a crack or problem, till I sat on it one too many times, but unlike an iPhone, I never had a crack, scratch, or screen problem. It just had a butt-impression as bad as my couch, and it started messing with my beloved, amazing, dual lense camera.

Now the upgrade. Am in love again. How can this camera get better? I bought the 6x and figured it was a camera with a phone attached. Now it's a better camera with a way better OS, speed, screen, everything.

No matter Android or Apple, you simply cannot this amount of bang for the buck. This is a thermonuclear blast for your buck.

Did I mention this is an amazing camera?",Positif
"So here's the thing. This phone is great, especially for the price. But you need to know going in that it's running EMUI. So it's gonna have some... issues. Sometimes it'll log you out of Chrome and there's just nothing to do. Both Huawei and Google know about this, but it's just kinda random luck. The screen looks beautiful, the camera is decent. Overall really happy with it.

Also, it's notifications are weird and I have no idea why. Like, it just won't give you notifications sometimes and you can't peek.",Positif
Not a bad phone but inferior to the Honor 5x. I loved that phone and when i smashed it on accident i looked for an upgrade. The camera is better then a Honor 5x but everything else is worse. The bluetooth and wifi use the same antenna. When i use my bose headphones on youtube the video lags in anything higher that 280p. When i turn off the wifi and use 4g everything is golden. Good thing i have unlimited data. The GPS is basicaly usless. Im not sure if its something ive done but the GPS is constantly seaching for signal. I have to basicaly hold out my window to get to catch signal but ill lose it constantly. So that is to be desired. All not a bad phone for 200 but i would not recommend or repurchase as it has many feature that are not usable.,Positif
"I bought this phone after doing a little research and deciding that I needed something with more memory than my Samsung On5. I have MetroPCS and they don't always give the best opportunity to get a good deal on a new phone if you already have them so I bought this one from Amazon and figured at $199, I can't really go wrong. The phone has exceeded my expectations in every way so far. The screen is larger than my old phone and it has 4 times the internal memory, the processing speed has had no problem so far. The cameras work great, the graphics are clear, the battery life is amazing. For the price, I really can't complain, also it showed it would not be in stock until the 26th (I ordered on the 24th), instead it ended up shipping the same day I ordered (the afternoon of the 24th) and arrived the next day! So far I'm very pleased with this phone!",Positif
I bought this after my Samsung S7 shit the bed. This is just as good and only at a fraction of the price. I think I'm done with flagship phones after realizing you're paying for nothing more than the name... And they're designed to fail after a certain amount of time anyway. Capitalism at its finest lol,Positif
"Upgraded from my old K20 plus to this. Works amazingly and the camera portrait mode makes pictures look amazing. For all those asking, yes it works with Metro PCS. You just have to call and say that you got a new phone that is confirmed to work on their service and provide them the information they request.",Positif
I like the phone a lot. I'm coming from an apple phone and I'm impressed. This they mid-range phone and it do so much more than the x. I got me a 256 gb memory card for the joint and I can put all my pirated music on it. No more apple music payments. And you can lock your apps for your girl won't be all in the joint . Facial recognition. Good camera And I made some good movies with it already. Umm I'm sticking Huawei from nown on. Bluetooth stay connected as well,Positif
"I am SO GLAD I bought this phone. I love everything about it! The storage is great, the photo quality is amazing, the fingerprint scanner works wonderfully. The only teensy tiny problem is how small the notification light is, I hardly notice it.
I haven't updated it because a past review said it messed up their phone, so I'm avoiding it.",Positif
"Plug and play phone that was easy to setup and switch. I was a loyal Samsung user but with the price of an average smartphone, I was ready to veer off the path and I couldn't be happier for $200. The phone feels like it's of quality materials, has excellent battery life, and connects seamlessly to Bluetooth devices. I wouldn't recommend this phone to a data junkie or someone who loves taking pictures, as the camera of my Galaxy s4 was better than this one and the internal storage isn't the best but it does have an micro SD card slot, so at least the storage can be remedied. Overall a great buy. I've been using without a hitch for over 2weeks??????",Positif
"this is an amazing phone. I used this phone for 6 months and loved it. it did everything my Samsung Note 5 did for the most part. I did have some issues when it came to missing APs on google play store but that could have been the version of android installed on the phone. The battery life is great. I could go all day at work with out needing a charge. The phone worked for UBER and Lyft while playing music.

The only thing that was not great on the phone was the camera quality but I watched dozens of reviews and knew it wasn't the best coming in.",Positif
"So the GPS on this thing is horrendous, it seems to only take readings around every half a minute or so, and it won't work for Pokemon Go or Google maps navigation. Other than that it is a near perfect phone, especially considering the price. I went to hihonor.com and talked to a honor representative about my GPS problem, but they just told me to factory reset my phone and It didn't fix my problem.",Negatif
"I bought this phone for travel purposes. I travel a lot for work and don't feel comfortable going everywhere with my iPhone. So, I take this with me. You can put in 2 sim cards or 1 sim and an SD. It takes calls, pictures, you can load music on the 32Gb and one very nice feature is the clone one that's on the phone. Lets you activate two WhatsApp, Messenger and so on at the same time without having to download an app from the PlayStore.
Overall best $200 phone I've ever had.",Positif
"Best feature: This phone is a bargain at this price point. Lots of the same or similar features as the Google Pixel 2 that cost 3 to 4 times what I paid for this. I'm very satisfied with the quality and appearance of this device and will definitely buy an upgrade Huawei next year.

Worst feature: After two weeks of normal use, my biggest complaint is that I've had to restart the device twice because it locked up. Not a deal breaker by any means.",Positif
Love this phone defiantly great phone and great purchase will recommend it for anyone,Positif
"I've had the phone for almost a week and a half. It should be said my uses and needs are basic; I only use it to browse, read, watch YouTube, and other basic stuff.

PROS
- Screen ratio is really good I like it alot. Splendid for reading and writing even. Split screen is awesome too.
- Battery lasts about two days with casual use.
- Price is of course unbeatable for a new smartphone that works well.
- Overall UI is alright
-32gb storage

CONS
-Only 2.4ghz wifi. Not deal breaker but would be nice
-I have had it glitch out once or twice, where no apps work properly for a period but that could be an app problem. It corrected itself soon enough.
- Takes forever to charge. Almost 2 hours from low battery if I remember correctly.
- Bluetooth has glitched off a few times.
- GSM only.

These are all the pros and cons I can think of in my case. I'm not a heavy user though.

Overall, even with the cons I'm happy with the phone. I'll have to update this post with how it's held up in a few weeks.",Positif
"I purchased this for my high school son to replace his old Tracfone cell phone. It is easy to transfer from old tracfone device to this honor 7x as long as the new sim card is inserted into it.

After about 2 weeks usage, my son like it very much and feel pretty good on the camera, finger print unlock feature and sort of Apps provided by the manufacturer.",Positif
"I don't know how long it will survive, but the phone is perfect. when you watch video in this phone the quality is not so high. But for this price it is very nice phone. I order one for my mom, and I will order one more for my dad)",Positif
"It's great! If you want to spend 800+ $ for the phone that's completely fine. Camera is great however if you want to take action shots ie games your doggie running you want get it obviously. But for the money you save you can actually get a decent camera for that. As far as apps, emei etc. Hey I got this phone to replace my Nexus 5. Yes I keep it for almost 5 years. I am more than satisfied. It is an amazing phone. I compared moto5x in any review I could and couldn't be happier to choose Honor7x. I hope that Amazon will continue to carry Huawei products unlike what Best Buy did. Price/features ratio 20/10.",Positif

The finger scan instantly unlocks. Watched some Amazon prime today. Big bright screen and speaker is great, too. I used the Huawei phone clone app, and it worked flawlessly transferring everything from my old Samsung S4. This feels like a huge upgrade, as you can imagine. No need to hesitate on this $200 phone. Will try to update after a few weeks.",Positif
I have an Hornor 6x that is a real good phone. But there were a couple of things that I didn't care for. Those problems were solved with the 7x. For $200 it is a steal. I've only had the phone for a day but I see and expect good things from this phone.,Positif
"I just purchased this, and it's a great phone so far. First off, the battery is fantastic. It charges really fast and lasts all day long. The screen is bright and has a quality picture. There's tons of storage space. Honestly, I don't know what more to say, other than I just love it so far. Of course, we'll see how it does in the long term, but so far, it's a great phone. Especially for the price!",Positif

I have always purchased cellphone brands that were less popular. I bought BLU phones for 5 years. I ran across this phone and gave it a chance based on the awesome specs. I bought an at&t byop kit for straight talk and it worked immediately. Awesome phone. Easy to use. Beautiful in every way. I'm glad I went with this one....,Positif
Works amazing for the price! Can't get anything better than this for the price. The huawei mate se is the exact same thing but has 64gb internal memory and 4gb ram if you perfer that for 250$ and the huawei y9 is 230$ and has dual rear and dual front cameras with 4000mah battery so if you want a better camera and battery go for that one but other than that its almost identical to the honor 7x and the mate se. I was happy with the specs and price on the honor 7x so i chose this one and so far it's worked really good.,Positif
High resolution and fairly snappy speeds. It feels substantial with the metal case. The software for the camera makes it more useful and the picture quality is good with the proper lighting. Sound is only adequate from the one speaker. Call quality is ok. Sometimes the GPS loses contact with the satellite during navigation. The phone is good for 160 dollars. It would be great for 100.,Positif
"Great battery life so far and tons of features. Fingerprint scanner is quick and the overall performance is snappy.

Two big things it's lacking are a Type C port and AC Wifi but for $200 I'm not going to complain.",Positif

"Considering its price (I paid $180) this is an exceptional phone. The camera is above average, obviously not a good as the higher end cameras on newer Samsungs and iPhones but for my purposes, good enough. Workmanship is phenomenal. An included app made it a breeze copying apps and settings from my older (also android) phone. Highly recommended.",Positif

"It’s an impressive device for $200. But for some people, paying more to get a better phone still makes sense. Also, no 5GHz Wi-Fi and no NFC are two big bummers. I would’ve liked to see USB-C, but Honor has to reach their price, so oh well. Overall solid for $200.",Positif

Fast smartphone but ended up returning. I do not understand how this is recommended as one of the best budget camera phones and it has such a high megapixel count but it looks very poor. The only thing it provides is more saturated photos but the quality is not really good at all. Fast though,Positif
My son is very happy with this phone. It replaced his note 8 that he broke and I refused to let him spend that kind of money again. He says it does everything his note did it's just not as big.,Positif
"Was a sweet pickup until it started having problems after two months. I bought and received the Honor7x in Feb, and writing this review in mid April. I was thinking of writing the review after using it for three months, but it's suddenly been problem after problem. First month went by fine. I enjoyed the camera and it ran fairly smooth. Fingerprint sensor is really quick.. Now for the cons; calls don't last more than 15 minutes before it disconnects and I have to recall. It wasn't a big problem, but now calls won't last a minute. I've been experiencing some strange stutter when switching between basic apps. My phone has also randomly crashed about 4-5 times and just rebooted by itself. Sadly, this is all within only two months. Who knows what else will random start malfunctioning. Nice phone in specs, but save your money and perhaps look elsewhere.",Negatif
Wanted a good sized screen & performance . It has exceeded my expectations. A quality product made for a higher range. Thank you for the speedy delivery. I have been putting my 7x through the paces and happy with results.,Positif
I really like this phone. There are many cool features that don't come with other phones at this price point. There are a few quirks that are keeping me from giving 5 stars. I'm slightly tech savvy and I don't mind the quirks but I wouldn't recommend this phone to a person that isn't tech savvy.,Positif
After buying this phone I think I'm done with Samsung for good!!,Positif
Loving this phone. I bought this one after my iPhone start glitching and was informed it was about to completely die on me. I think it was a financially wise decision... Honor for $200 vs iPhone for $700-$1000. INSTANT SAVINGS!,Positif
This is the second Honor phone I've purchased. This is one fantastic phone for a very low price. The camera is amazing and the best I've ever seen on a smartphone. I use this phone on a net10 network and have used it on ATT and others. It is a true charmer. Well worth every penny and will be my go to again!,Positif
"Honestly, I can't believe how cheap this phone is. It is really good for the price. Is it not as fast or lacks certain features of the $1000 flagship phone on the market today? Yes, of course it does. However, in my opinion, those features do not equal the price differential between this and a flagship.",Positif
"I got this phone a month ago as I switched from my old Samsung phone to this and it went through easy, the phone still works fast but at times it can slow down if you have a lot of apps in the background, but not much of a worry. The camera is very great has a lot of features on it making it useful for taking photos. The screen is very good, lots of color on it. It's battery lasts for about 14 hours on heavy usage for me which is pretty good. Over all I haven't found any other issues or anything I didn't like so I really would recommend this phone.",Positif
"I bought this phone on Amazon and have been using it for 2 weeks. It looks premium and shockingly beautiful for a $200 phone.

"I have been using the honor 7x for a month now and there haven't been any problems. The phone is reliable and fast given its price. For around 200 USD, the phone has many useful features and the battery can last up to around a day on normal use. However, I've found that the phone doesn't run stock Android (like google) but uses EMUI, which is a software with some skins layering android. Nonetheless, the honor 7x has been a breeze to use and I hope it improves in the future.",Positif

"When Honor released the 7X I was all over it since day 1. After owning the 6X I figured the 7X would be worth the upgrade. For $200 you are getting plenty bang for your buck. The blue color is nice, the screen is nice and the camera is okay. But having owned it since February there are some downfalls. Honor still hasn't fixed the auto brightness bug, the touch screen responsiveness is still a bit wonky at times, and the battery is starting to drain pretty quick. On top of these issues, the rattling sound from the camera made me think I had a defective device but it seems to be just the phone itself. I will admit that the 7X does take pretty nice pictures. The phone gets pretty hot quickly during normal usage and the battery drains fast. I never had that issue with the 6X. The lack of cases available for the 7x is also another downfall for me. I just wouldn't consider this device a major upgrade from the 6X. If you have a 6X, hold off until the 8X comes out. If you need a phone, look for another option or wait until the 8X comes out, which should be soon in the US actually!",Positif
so far so good. takes a bit get use to like most new toys. but strait away. the screen top area is tooo small and annoying. maybe I will find away to make it bigger? but over all fast. feels real classy to. its slimmer than the picture shows it as. so better in person. good weight to it. doesnt feel like gonna snap strait away.

"It’s a budget phone with its price tag. I love it being light and one almost feels nothing in your hand. The reason why I didn’t give more than 3 stars are that the phone doesn’t support 2 sims as described. One sim supported 2g/3g/4g, great and 2nd sim only have 2g, very worst. I bought it to 2 sims. I don’t expect the Face ID work likely my IPhone XsMax.",Positif
"I'm holding off on giving this phone a 5 until I get more time with it, as it just arrived today. If you get blue, be aware it's a darker blue than the picture would suggest. It's more of a navy than a bright blue, but that's fine with me. I haven't tested the wifi as of yet, so I can't verify any claims about how good/bad it is. Pro's and Con's so far:

Pros:
- Contrary to some things I've been reading, we ordered two of these, one black and one blue, and both are getting 4g service through AT&T, so that hasn't been a problem for us.
- The fingerprint sensor is SUPER snappy so far, by far the fastest way to unlock the phone, and to my pleasant surprise you can register up to 5 fingers in the settings, so multiple people can be given permissions to unlock the phone with that option if you so choose, which is incredibly nice. It's also good to note that out of the box the phone has the option to toggle on and off extra functions for that sensor, which lets you answer calls, pull down the notification menu, etc., which is quite convenient.
-The phone feels well constructed, and the aluminum body makes it feel stout. It's been in my pocket (with thin rigid case and screen protector) through work and I've stopped worrying for the most part about accidentally cracking the screen. The phone is quite rigid and feels durable.
-The camera is great. There's a plethora of features built in with Huawei's software, and it's given me some amazing shots (I'll include at least one with this updated review). It'll take some experimenting to get used to, and it will also take practice to learn what works best when, but overall I'm extremely happy. It won't do 4k or anything that great, but I hardly expected it to.
-For a ""cheap"" phone the speakers are more than passable. You won't get amazing depth of sound or anything (these are phone speakers, after all) but audio is clear and loud enough for my uses.
- I've yet to get this phone under %50 battery, but I'm not a power user. It's greatest test so far as been as a GPS device for about a 4hr round trip, with the screen on about 3/4 of that time along with my normal light use. Heavy users will likely have more problems with it, but if you manage how many things you have going on in the background it's not a problem.
-I cannot complain at all about screen quality here. If anything I'm thoroughly impressed. Colors are true, lines are crisp, and it responds to touch without issue. It looks beautiful.

Cons:
-The first minor thing is that if you're ordering it for AT&T you might need to mess with some APN settings when you first set it up. It's an inconvenience but nothing serious that other phones don't also have to deal with.
-I do have one mildly irritating issue with headphone audio, which honestly is barely worth mentioning. I think it's due to the phone turning off power to audio devices to conserve battery life, but when I have headphones in (and only then), a second or two after audio is stopped there's a squeak or pop. It's the same noise you would hear plugging headphones into the headphone jack or wiggling the wire on a dying pair of headphones to get it to reconnect and play sound. It's slightly irritating, but not enough to dampen my enjoyment of this phone.
-Some will consider this a Con, but I don't mind it personally. As of now this phone is still running Android 7.0 Nougat, without an option to upgrade to the newest Oreo software. This is supposed to change, however I haven't found a solid date on when the update will roll out to this device.
- The phone does not support USB type C. This doesn't bother me in the least, but some people prefer it for various (legitimate) reasons.

Overall, this is an amazing device for the cost, and I can't recommend it enough. It doesn't help that I'm still getting a kick out of showing it to people and seeing the look of shocked disbelief on their faces when I inform them that this sleek, snappy device is a Huawei, which in my area has a reputation for being the bad end of cheap. Holding it up to a friend's Samsung Galaxy Note 8, it's nearly identical in size, and in brief comparison seemed just as high quality, and it's a surprise to people that it's not a flagship phone.",Positif
I upgraded from the 5X to the 7X. Love the speed and the ability to multitask. The addition of the equalizer is really nice with headphones. Android 8 has nice new features. The only thing I don't like is how the notification light works. It's not as responsive as the one in the 5X.,Positif

Screen is amazing but camera is so so. I bought this for my mother and quickly became envious of the gorgeous screen and how it's just slightly faster than my Honor 6x. My mother loves how the large screen is easy for her to read and type her messages.,Positif
"Works very well impressed loaded with many programs you may need right from the start easy to operate.
I can now send text and emails on my consumer cellular plan that I could never do before with the phone
I purchased from them with my phone plan.",Positif
I truly think this brand makes some of the best phones for the buck. This phone is missing quick charge and USB C compared to my old phone but with the battery life I really don't notice it. I never used any other of the C options.,Positif
"Amazed that this phone is just 200 unlocked. Not a shill, just thinking about all the money I wanted on iphones in the past several years.",Positif
2nd purchase love it. My son is now using the old one.,Positif
"This is a very good quality phone that compares to the latest phones for a fraction of the price. It takes super clear pictures, better then my iPhone 6 did. It also has a good amount of internal storage that an be upgraded with a micro sd card.",Positif
Fantastic smartphone,Positif
The best phone I have ever had. Love it!,Positif
"4 months in and the back light is out for the screen,rendering it useless",Positif
"It has lots of excellent features and well built. Good size in the hand and light enough. However I prefer a better screen ( a bit washed out, especially in day light), fast charging, wireless charging).",Positif
I didn't know what to expect with this phone. The bad reviews truly don't do this phone any justice. I've been using this phone for about 2-3 months now and it's been great. The camera quality is surprisingly beautiful. My instagram pictures have been elevated ever since I got this phone. The fingerprint unlock feature has made me lazy with its convenience.,Positif
"I really liked the look and feel of the phone. It was very fast for about two weeks but then the screen started freezing. I would have to push the power button to get to my home screen and then start again on the webpage I was looking for. I thought it might have been my wifi but No, it happened with mobile data as well as other wifis. It may just have been this phone but I didn't want to take a chance so I asked for a refund.",Negatif
"Best $200 Android phone out there. Not going to outperform my OnePlus 5T, but it is everything a non-power-user could want. Camera is pretty meh, but that is par for the course in this price range.",Positif
"A awesome phone for cheap. It's fast, fingerprint reader beats the Pixel 2, no noticeable difference in performance from the galaxy 8. You will not be sorry unless you get a lemon.",Positif
For the money you can't beat it. Just buy it,Positif
"I really like this phone overall, it's fast and easy to use. I thought the camera would be a bit better, but my expectations are pretty high, so don't let that deter you. It's a good value phone.",Positif
"Had about a month now. Batttery is still great, phone is working flawlessly. Really enjoying this thing. Well worth the price.",Positif
Seems like a pretty decent phone so far. Fingerprint reader is cool even though it usually takes multiple tries. I wish the power button was above the volume buttons. Battery life is good. Camera is good.,Positif
"Been awaiting delivery of the Honor 7x for a couple weeks now. Just for comparison sake, I owned a OnePlus 3T prior to picking up this phone. The OnePlus was slowing down quite a bit, so I sold it and took a portion of the proceeds and gave the Honor 7x a try. I owned the Honor 5x a few years ago, and had a decent experience with it.

Like I said, so far, so great. I'm only 6 hours into the experience, but I can say that this is one impressive phone for the price. I did quite a bit of homework before purchasing and was between a few devices, but this was the only one under $300 that I was considering. The screen ratio is one of the best aspects of the phone. The build is solid and the software layer is pretty usable. I haven't yet needed to go to Nova. If you put this in front of anyone with a bit of knowledge about the landscape of phones out there, I would bet they would guess that this phone is priced between $300-$400.

Will update after a week of use. Don't hesitate...buy, buy, buy!",Positif
"Have had galaxies for years, decided to try this because it was so much more cost effective. Fabulous phone is every bit as good as my galaxies, photos are better, very easy to use, great quality at a very small price.",Positif

"Everything is exceptionally good except the camera, which is still good enough for me since I don't take a lot of photos.

Update: It's been a few months and I still have no objections with this phone other than the camera, but I had worse before.",Positif
Item freeze all the time drop Bluetooth and you have to reboot to reconnect again,Negatif
"Buy it. You honestly will not regret it. Though, its not on Android 8 or 9 (whatever the lastest is). It runs on 7 and works, in my opinion, faster than an iPhone 6s and/or 7. Very good phone for the price",Positif
For the price its a nice phone but the GPS is terrible. Playing Pokiemon go you cannot stay near gyms long enough to battle or raid. However it gives zero GPS drift credit.,Positif

I loved my honor 5x so i thought ok ill try this phone what i'm disappointed in is the notification light its a big deal to me because i sometimes have my phone turned all the way down and i have come to expect to see a notification come in by just looking at the light pulsating but the light on this phone is so faint and the blue is hard to see and in comparison.. i think my honor 5x was faster if you can believe that..anyway i maybe returning this phone and not sure if ill be sticking with this brand ...my honor 5x is still working by the way for almost two yrs now.. I bought this thinking i would get an awesome phone and it is in some ways... but ((((NOTIFICATION LIGHT IS HARD TO SEE)))). i also bought this phone thinking encase my honor 5x dies ..,Positif

"My MotoG 4th edition wouldn't charge, so I ordered this phone as a replacement. Turns out my MotoG started charging again (must have been a moisture problem)...but by that point I was in love with the Honor 7x - its thinner, faster, and the camera is a lot easier to use. I'm a convert who loves the 7X.....",Positif
"Processing is a little bit slower than most smartphones, and you have to close down most other apps to use the camera. That said, the phone works great, has a good amount of memory, and is sleek and modern looking. Battery life is excellent, and the screen resolution and picture quality are great. An amazing deal for the price.",Positif

Ordered for teenage son. Lasting much longer than last two iPhones.,Positif
"I've had this phone over a week now and like it more each day. I had been attached to my HTC One M9 but it had contracted degenerative terminal battery disease; symptoms include spontaneous power off and battery standby of an hour or less. As the disease ran it's inevitable course I knew I had to replace it. Investigation of possible battery transplant offered little hope. The new HTC U11 was way out of my price range also one thing I really wanted was offline FM radio and because wireless companies prefer that you use data it's frequently only on one-off brands and cheap phones. I kept running across the Huawei honor7x. While there are some scathing reviews, there are some scathing reviews for every phone so the percentage of good reviews must be taken into consideration. The screen quality, camera, battery, processor & GPU, my offline FM radio, and Tricorde-resque plethora of sensors, overall build tells me I've made the right decision. Since receiving it Wednesday I've charged it 3 times. I was charging my HTC 3-6 times per day and even that was insufficient. The complaints in the harsher reviews of the Huawei honor7x frequently indicate ""lagging"" but they also say it's resolved by a reboot, "" only to return again at some point in the future.
So for a $200 phone with premium features, occasionally one may have to turn it off then on again. THE HORROR!!
Others dislike the micro USB vs USB-C. I personally am relieved I don't need to replace my numerous charging cables. Also, complaints about no Qualcomm quick charge.
With light to moderate use, the H7X lasts me 3 days between charges. Also, it's 1/4 the price of a premium phone. If they are going to omit something I'm glad it's that. What else? Oh no wireless charging either. While inductive oscillating charging is kinda neat, it's slow, hard on circuitry due to heat and testy, if your device isn't right on the correct spot it doesn't charge so you just put your phone down for a while, which can be a good thing on its own, but it still needs changing. So again, it's$200, and if you feel that strongly about wireless charging you can buy a kit. Personally I think my $200 phone should go to work for me in the morning so I can sleep, keep me sexually gratified and cook my dinner, but that's not what phones do. Conversely, if you are not willing to spend close to $1000 on a phone there are some things that you are going to have to do without. That being said, the H7X isn't really a compromise, you are getting far more for your money in my book! Thank you Huawei! Excellent phone at an excellent value!",Positif

"UPDATED REVIEW:

Changing my four star review after a month of solid use to a measly two stars. The original review is below. After a month of use, about half the time the phone locks up. You can have about three or four windows open at a time before things start getting a little unusable. Sometimes it'll happen with just a single window open and sometimes it will happen with NO WINDOWS open. Still, this is not the worse part. The worse part is that the phone and/or apps will become unresponsive without you knowing. Many times, my Nike Run Club has crashed and missed 15-30 minutes worth of my run because it crashed and the phone still showed the app running in the background. I never had the same issue with my Axon 7 or my Galaxy S7. Using GPS to get to a work-site you've never been before? Good luck. Same problem happens.

The sound and video quality remains solid and I still think the phone itself is absolutely BEAUTIFUL.

Although this is nothing against the phone itself, I am unable to find tempered glass that will stay on longer than two weeks which leaves my phone vulnerable to damage at super inconvenient times and forces me to rush order new tempered glass so that I can preserve it as much as I can. It's disappointing that not many manufacturers are manufacturing good quality accessories for this device. Again, nothing against the phone but if you really want to protect it, there's not many good options that will work long enough to be worth it.

I kept thinking to myself, how can a phone this beautiful have such subpar performance on a regular basis? I get overheating phones, or having way too many apps and windows open, or trying to do too much at a single time but this phone can barely handle an email window open, a browser in the background, and a water time app waiting in the background for my water intake. Save yourself some headache and buy something different. I'm going to have to replace it with something that can handle my typical usage, which believe me, is not crazy. I mostly use my phone for work. At most it'll have my work app, my work email, and a browser open. Even then it suffers in performance. If you're a power user or use your phone a lot for everything or just use your phone in moderation, this is a hard pass. If you only ever have one or two apps open at most, and you're okay with your phone locking up at any time for any reason, then you'll probably get by.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

For $200.00, you can't beat the quality.

Especially when you first setup the phone, the phone will be under a great deal of load. It's a no-brainer since your phone is usually installing all of your apps from your previous phone and the corresponding updates for the system as well. Still, even casual use will lock up the phone. This isn't a huge deal. Close your 4 million apps and try performing the same task again, it should work without issue. That being said, as someone who needs to use this phone for IT work, the lock up can be frustrating sometimes. If you're on a budget and you want a little better performance, plop down the extra $30 and go for the 4GB, 64GB version of this phone found here (trust me, I wish I had done the same but it's not worth the effort just yet): Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked 5.93"" - 4GB/64GB Octa-core Processor| 16MP + 2MP Dual Camera| Grey (US Warranty)

The 5.93"" phone screen is AMAZING. I put it right next to my brother's iPhone X, who by the way had been bragging about his new iPhone X for months, and he went quiet before releasing a subtle ""wow."" When I told him how much money it cost, he shook his head in disbelief. Screen transitions can be customized, you can add 5x6 app tiles, and the stock backgrounds and lock screens are visually pleasing to look at. Sometimes I find myself waking my phone just to remind myself of how awesome the phone really is.

Storage is a bit of a bust. The system takes about half the storage of the phone. If you buy a 32GB, be ready to have about 18GB of storage to actually use. Again, if you're on a budget but you need double the storage, check the link I posted earlier because that is the exact same phone with an extra GB of RAM and an extra 32GB of storage on top of what this phone currently has.

My only regret is that I didn't upgrade for $30 to 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage but you can be assured that once you have this phone, you'll forget what a galaxy or iPhone is, or why they even exist.",Negatif

"It's a surprisingly good phone for it's price category. But not without flaws. One very annoying problem with the phone is that some apps can freeze and remain non-responsive for minutes. I have this problem quite often with the camera app and Google Maps. Just because of that I'm thinking of switching back to my Moto G5, which was performing flawlessly except that I wasn't happy with the quality of the photos. I got Honor 7X because it's supposed to have a very good picture quality. And the phone UI is very responsive and perfroms quite well except at times when the apps are frozen/stuck. The phone is very nice overall, good signal and call quality, no issues with bluetooth, nice, large screen, battery rarely drops to 50% at night. The speaker isn't as good as the one on Moto G5 (wow that thing can be loud), the phone ringing and notifications are much easier to miss on the Honor.",Positif

Best quality/price phone in the market right now. Bought it from Canada and it was still well worth it!,Positif
"For some reason, Huawei thinks it's a good idea to allow the phone operating system to kill/restrict 3rd party apps. During the 2 months of use, the system kills my alarm app 3 times, and twice of my game (playing). You can do some search up on Google about this ""feature"" they called ""ram management."" The feature is good to improve the performance of the phone if executed perfectly; especially for phones with less impressive hardware. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oneplus, Meizu, Lenovo, and Asus are well known for this ""feature."" Unfortunately, these companies code ""so-so"" quality software experience. The ""feature"" is not execute perfectly and kills needed apps.",Negatif

keeps force closing any apps. camera takes forever to open or it won't open at all ,ohh and don't use the wide aperture option it won't work .
you cannot have many apps open it freezes too, i have to keep closing to free the memory it says 3gb of ram but it feel like a 1gb ram with 1/2 already in use :/ :(.
body build looks amazing like the iPhones but not that strong i just dropped it this morning with a protective cace ON but that didn't stop from breaking the screen :( .",Positif

Very good seller and good product.,Positif
"I love this phone. For the price, it is definitely a steal. Nothing can beat its price and quality. Wow the camera, man, it is ridiculously great... The only thing I wish for is if the LCD colors were sharper which is not a big deal. It is fast, really fast compared with my old phone, Samsung S5. I will update my review if anything comes up...I just have had it for a couple of days now.",Positif

"Amazing bargain of a phone! I bought this to replace an Alcatel Idol 3 that was a very good phone but mysteriously expired after many years of service. The Honor 7x is handsome and stylishly thin, the screen is beautiful and has really thin bezels, the performance is snappy, fingerprint unlock is nearly instantaneous, the camera does the cool defocused backgrounds, it comes with a nifty clear protective case, it's super-easy to set up, it comes with twice the internal memory of comparably priced competitors and one and a half times as much RAM, I mean, come on people. This phone makes the people who throw down $1000 for the latest iPhone look even sillier than they did before.",Positif
delivery was really slow! but the phone its awesome!,Positif
Present for my daughter who loves the phone.,Positif
"very good , super for $200",Positif
"This is a great mid price range cell phone. Compact, fast with large, clear screen. In my opinion this phone is as good as many premium phones. To keep the price down it lacks a couple of features such as NFC and dual Wi-Fi. Very good battery life.The phone came with a nice clear, shook resistant case.",Positif
Great cellphone.,Positif
It's good,Positif
"Update (4 days later after purchase)
Unfortunately, I had to drop 2 stars after using the phone for 4 days. I started to hit serious lag. It seems like reviews you may find on youtube are reviewing the 4GB/64GB international version, because the US version with the 3GB/32GB is just not on par with the international version.
Why I dropped 2 stars?
- No 5ghz wifi connectivity. This is a serious bummer, since I only connect to the 5ghz frequency on my home wifi, since I had problems with other devices connecting and my wifi router routinely dropping some off the wifi-list,unless it's on the 5ghz freq. This is kinda interesting, since as far as I can remember, even phones from 2014 had ac 5ghz option.
- Extremely slow charging. I just can't get around with this. I can see people charging their phones at night, but there are phones out now with the same $200+ price range that do fast charging. Micro USB is one thing, there are phones that fast-charge with it, but again, we are in 2018.
- No NFC. Granted, there are only a few budget phones with NFC, but we need to look at from the point of view of the year 2018 just began and within a few months, more budget phones are coming out, packed with more features than ever before, even with NFC. Let this be the least of the problems, it's a compromise that most people can live with, if they don't use NFC (not using their phones with Google Play or transfer files etc. )
- Here is the worst. After several days, the phone began to lag. Whether it's from the new update, that popped up during setup, whether it's something to do with lesser memory than most phones or the interface itself, I don't know. I ended up disabling apps to gain some speed back, including disabling amazon apps, navigation apps and the built in Huawei apps. Then it continued. Browsing a webpage is like the scrolling acceleration is disabled or just the lag gets worse. Keep shutting down recently used apps won't help. Rebooting won't help, there is a constant lag while browsing in Chrome and in Facebook, something I don't experience in other budget phones for years now. Hopefully Huawei can address this in future updates, or could be just a few particular models effected, I don't know. It can get very annoying. There is something going on with the memory management, whatever, I am not an expert, but it just ruins the experience.
Speaker is ok, but still very tiny sound. Again, we are talking about a $200 phone, but consider the trade-offs.
In a nutshell, here is what to keep an eye out for when purchasing this phone:
+Nice bright screen, small bezels,
+Good camera for the price
+notification LED (many people prefer it)
+battery lasts a day for most people
+fingerprint reader is lightning fast
+Love/Hate heavy launcher skin over Android OS
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Lag can creep up after a certain amount time, restart needed, apps needs to be disabled, /wait for more updates?/
- Still on Android Nougat, no confirmed date for Oreo update
- Heavy launcher skin over Android OS
- No dual band wifi
-No NFC
-US version : 3GB RAM/32GB of onboard space
-Micro USB
-No fast charging
-No 4K recording capability
-No image stabilization
-tiny single speaker at the bottom
----------------------------------
At this point, I had luck to use the Honor 6X for 2 weeks last year and it was great. I would recommend that phone over this one.",Positif
Extremely happy with the phone so far. It was everything I expected.,Positif
Great product,Positif
"I am pretty sure this is the best deal for the $200 price tag. I would recommend a oneplus phone for $500 or the essential phone, but if you only have $200 you can't go wrong with this. I have cricket and it works well.

Every phone has spyware in it. Like this one tells me how many footsteps I have taken each day (which means it knows where I have been). Every phone does this and I am glad it is more upfront about it.

If you are on a military installation, I recommend Sony, Apple, Samsung, or Nokia (stick to the allies).",Positif
Good no problems.,Positif
"This phone didn't even really function. It froze all the time, and it took at least 10 seconds to open the camera, if ever. You could even see faces in sunny pictures, just a weird face outline.",Negatif
"This device has mediore specs for the price, the Mate SE has an extra gig of ram and 64g's of storage for less than $40 more but my deal breaker was that, this phone will not send videos in any capacity. The camera records in 720p but no matter the length of videos, the phone still will not send in MMS messages. Not sure if this will be the same issue on the Mate SE but buyer beware on this phone especially if you're on At&t's network !!!",Negatif
It's not a bad device for what it offers cameras decent battery is a swell decent will get you through a whole day screen is good you why is not very resource dependence it's been said that it will receive 8.0 Oreo per honor I would recommend,Positif
"I bought this as a replacement for my old Google Nexus 5 and have had it for about a month now. The phone is great value for money and seems to do everything better+faster than my old one. Based on my experience with a Samsung tablet, I was expecting a ton of bloatware compared to the pure Android implementation of the Nexus but I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case. A few popular apps that I don't use, Facebook and Instigram, we're pre-installed but I was able to delete these easily. I use it with Tmobile and it works great.",Positif
"The phone is great but the customer service and warranty sucks. Manufacture warranty covets up to a year. Ive had the phone for 4 months, the screen cracks and they won't cover it. Extremely pissed off",Negatif
This is Nice Phone with Cool extra Features and it doesn't come whit all junk bloatware that AT&T store Phones come with,Positif
So far my 2 daughters are very happy and sattisfied with their new cel phones. It seems that fits the specs as promised. Long long lasting battery and great quality and sharp screen. Need to purchase a good screen protector because the ones I ordered for the two phones were of a terrible quality and I lost my money.,Positif
"To anyone who is considering to buy this pone. I am telling you this, it is a steal, it is a catch. Do not hesitate or think twice to buy it. This phone is so awesome!",Positif
"So far I am loving my new phone! My only issue is that I can't connect the data. That, however, is more of a provider issue that it is an issue with the phone. It has so many bells and whistles that I may spend the rest of my life just trying to make heads or tails of them. It has more to offer than anything!!!!!",Positif
"A nice fast good looking cellphone at a reasonable price. Does everything I need. I do not do games on a phone as I use it for making calls, browsing the internet, messaging and emails. I am not big on cameras though the one provided seems to be perfectly adequate.Its not an iPhone X or a Galaxy S8 but who cares.",Positif
Great for the price!,Positif
Great phone so far for what the price was. Awesome screen. Hope it lasts long.,Positif
I opened the Box and fell in love with this phone. The phone is fast great quality beautiful to look at and all around just a great phone. I recommend this phone for people on a budget or looking for something different.,Positif
Phone had too many bugs. I see all the awesome reviews maybe I just had a bad unit. My biggest problem was no matter what I sat the screen time out to it shut off in 10 seconds.,Negatif
"Great deal for the price, its fast, good image quality, the only negative point = is a little bit bulky/heavy, but I am very pleased with the phone",Positif
"Amazing mid range phone with a budget price, but ilte does not work on the freedom mobile network in Canada. I checked the bands 4 and 7 for this phone before purchasing, and both are supported by freedom. So frustrated by this since hspa speeds are very slow and honor tech support is not replying back",Negatif
"I really enjoyed buying this phone. Nothing to gripe about because you can simply change your launcher. As for the bloatware, almost all of it can be disabled or moved to an SD card.

Overall 5/5 would buy again. I recommend this phone for anyone who is on a bit of a budget but still needs power and customization.",Positif
Very good. Except that Bluetooth is somewhat quirky. Eg. Fitbit will not connect.,Positif
I have never written a bad review on Amazon because 99% of the time I'm very happy with what I get or I exchange it without issue! This phone is a disaster freezes every 5 minutes opens up applications without me touching them calls and dials random people this phone sucks big time you get what you pay for and this is trash,Negatif
Just dont open too many apps at once :/,Positif
"-EDIT-
After exactly 1 month(Product arrived Jan 27, today is Feb 27), the phone is bricked. I was just listening to spotify, heard a notification go off, so I tried to unlock screen to view my message. The screen wouldn't cut on. I pressed the power button a few more times, eventually it cut on for a brief second and then just cut off again. I figured it was just being slow, so I opted to restart the phone. When the phone turned on, it constantly goes to the EMUI eRecovery page, which always fails to update to fix my phone. As of now, my phone is bricked and unusable. I've heard that flashing the stock firmware might work? I don't know much about that stuff, but from what I understand, Huawei doesn't normally make their stock firmware public for months after release and I cannot go months without a phone due to the nature of my work. I essentially just have a $200 paperweight now.

--OLD REVIEW--
Absolutely love it. Phone lasts 3-4 days with light usage, day and a half with constant usage(Such as hours and hours of Netflix, or some light gaming) Only reason it isn't a 5-star, isn't necessarily a fault of the 7x, it's more-so a feature of theirs that doesn't like to work with Android well. The 18:9 screen, while excellent, imo, for viewing pleasures, the screen sometimes acts a little weird and doesn't register me pressing a button, so I have to double tap every once in a while. Not a huge problem, imo, however. I can live with that, overall, I love the phone.",Negatif
So far I'm loving this phone. Will update review if need be,Positif
Solid phone. Like this $200 phone better better than my $800 Samsung S8+!,Positif
"Working great. It a mid range cellphone, so it will not have all the specification of a P10 Plus, but it works for a person that like to have a lots of app with running low of storage.",Positif
"Freezes with heavy app usage. Otherwise, the functionality and design exceeds some flagship phones. Signal strength is very strong. Overall, good product.",Positif
Picture looks good but slow,Negatif
"This phone is super underrated... It's amazing in every aspect. I'll do a full review, but now I'm being lazy.
If you are a selfie person, this phone is for you.",Positif
"The phone lags like crazy, brand new - tried everything - flashed everything, installed latest OS update - LAG like hell.
No support - nothing to do.

Will not recommend to anyone even for a budget phone.",Negatif
"Great Phone! I thought since it was a Chinese phone that it would be alright but its more than that, and for 200 dollars just cant beat it.",Positif
Charges super slow and apps are slow sometimes,Negatif
"I had the 7x brand new and 3 weeks later it suddenly went to a reboot cycle, the phone keeps showing booting screen and was stuck in it, had to contact Huawei service center and get it send in for repair, I'm disappointed at the build quality even though the phone is really nice to use.",Negatif
Phone a little slow but good for $200. I am using a galaxy s8+ .This phone is a gift . Phone feels slow but cant complain because its so cheap .,Positif
"Really hate this phone! I really hate the fact that you can't move apps to the SD card because the manufacture disable this function in their modified version of android. This is so you can buy a phone with much more storage space. This phones and phones that disable the ability to moved apps to the SD card are made for manufacture profits and not consumers needs. On many occasions when I talking on the phone the person I'm talking to can't hear me. I have to put the phone on speaker or Blu-tooth (if I can get it to connect). I have the hardest time connecting Blu-tooth devices. At this present time none of my Blu-tooth headphone will connect. The camera and video playback are ok.
This phone came pre-installed with a bunch of crappy apps that take up unnecessary space. I paid over 200$ for this lousy phone because I thought I was getting a decent cellphone. Now I have to purchased another phone because this one can't do its main function which is to allow me to talk on it. It you need a cellphone stay away from this one! Get a Samsung or a iPhone.",Negatif
"Looks nice. Snappy in some areas. However, the processor is the deal breaker. Many times, even though it's new, launching the camera takes 15+ seconds. Imagine how that might affect the moment. Additionally, app to app transition has frozen the phone a few times already. Thankfully Amazon.com is exceptional and I'm sending this back after 3 weeks of use. Sometimes you get high function on the cheap. Not this time.

Update: limping through my last night before I ship this phone back. I'm reducing to 2/5. The lag is beyond unacceptable.",Negatif
I had high expectations for this phone due to the specs but it turned out to be disappointing it has a nice screen and other features you find on high end phones but the phone seemed slow and lagged when pressing the screen. I ended up returning the phone. Maybe I just got a defective one but I would not recommend it. For this price point your better off with a Sony experia,Negatif
Pro -Love the look and feel of the phone. Cons- no 5ghz wifi only 2.4ghz. has a 5 bar scale for data/phone reception yet on average 3 bars but mostly 2 and even 1!! Very disappointed in the antenna ! I'm with Virgin Mobile which runs on the Bell Network in Canada and Bells coverage is all over. On an LTE service yet doesn't help ...needs to have better hardware,Positif
"Update (6-27-18)

This was a 1 star review, every issue I was experiencing was fixed by the recently released Oreo update. It's quick but not blazing fast like some of the popular flagship phones. I'm happy with my purchase, ..finally!

The phone is slow and lags, can take up to 20 seconds for the camera app to launch. I've done a complete reinstall, faster memory, and cleared the cache multiple times. I've reached out to Huwaei and they sent an automated email with useless suggestions. A quick search on the internet will backup my claim.

The Moto offered but Amazon is smaller and has a huge bezel that I really don't care for but zero issues in 7-8 months. I'm taking it out of the drawer and going back, I should have never purchased this phone.",Positif
"While the phone is great in general, the one we bought had a major speaker issue. Even at half volume, sound coming from the speaker was garbled. If you turn up the volume, it is almost not comprehensible. This is pretty unacceptable since we cannot use the speaker to watch any videos or speak on the phone. We are returning the phone.",Negatif
its a great phone exept the times it becomes sluggish and slow out of nowhere wich is sadly pretty often.,Positif
It looks like it is a fabulous phone but I cannot use it. Thanks Honor 7x doesn't accept my Total wireless plan. ??,Positif
I prefer a larger phone. Second SIM reception is subpar,Positif
Nice phone with all new features. Slim and sleek,Positif
"I lke the big screen, but the unit is weak in transmission",Negatif
Terrible camera.,Negatif
Mine is junk. Constant hangups. Have to restart 2-3 times per day. Sending it back for refund.,Negatif
"Just Great cellphone the only thing i did not like its the speaker, and charge port are bottom of cellphone",Positif
"Was an awesome phone until system update, caused touch screen to become unresponsive at times, having to press harder and longer in order to get it to work. So disappointed.",Negatif
"Got this phone for a replacement phone from an 6X... screens blew apart on two of them within days from small drops. These were small drops. Literally less than a 12 inch drop as it slid out of my pocket on the first one and the 2nd one equally small. Clumsy yes but, had it in a case... had the screen protector and shattered. The 6X was a beast and I have them for my sons as well as had one for me. I did order the insurance on the 2nd unit and will wait to try and see how that process works...",Negatif
"The shipping is longer than expected but the phone is definitely the best in the budget segment some drawbacks include the micro usb, occasional lag due to the outdated processor being used and no 4glte only 2g mobile data.",Positif
"Loved the Honor 5x. It was my first Honor phone. I expected the 7x to be at least as good. The Honor 7x had been nothing but problematic for me. To be clear the phone works great as an Android platform but is unreliable as an actual phone. After trying two att carriers h2o and straight talk and multiple days of tech support for each no one knows what's causing calls to be missed, calls straight to voicemail and delayed text messages. On top of this having Bluetooth on significantly slows wifi speeds. Unfortunately I cannot return the phone to Amazon.

Update: Was able to get phone returned to Amazon for a partial refund. I was given a bit of a runaround but it worked out after a few hours on the phone and on chat. Topping off the bad experience was Honor stating that the defect fell under a non covered article of their limited warranty.",Negatif
"I have almost no applications installed and running on this phone, and yet it still frequently freezes in OS under seemingly no load. My first Huaweai phone was the Nexus 6p and it eventually failed, and this one is seemingly turning into that same situation. I want to like Huawei as a brand, but I continually have issues with their product",Negatif
"Great phone for the price, however, if you can get the Global version instead of the US version get it instead. You get one more gig of ram and more storage. Consider the Xiaomi MI A1 if you could afford a sightly higher phone.

Honor 7x has a better screen, sightly bigger battery and a customizable ui skin but lacks due to having to charge via Micro Usb. The MI A1 has a smaller screen, smaller battery, but has usb c. The Honor also has a dedicated fm radio app unlike the the MI A1.

The US version has 3gigs of ram, 32gb of storage for ~$199.99, and a 5.93"" screen.
While the Mi A1 has 4gigs of ram and 64gbs of storage while being around ~$250 with around 5"" screen.",Positif
"My first impression of this phone was that it’s a great phone which rival’s phones that cost double its price. Both the build quality and display are premium. Initially, I was a little worried about purchasing a phone with something other than stock Android on it since that’s what my previous phone (a Nexus 5x) was running, but the EMUI interface isn’t bad at all and I didn’t consider it a downgrade once I used it.

The Honor 7x ships with a little bloatware installed, most of which can be removed. Some apps such as SwiftKey cannot be uninstalled, although you can set the default to the Google keyboard app instead. The phone also ships with a clear case that’s good enough to use until you know you’re going to keep the phone.

I spent almost an entire day getting everything setup only to later discover that the Honor 7x is not compatible with Fitbit devices. It will not sync no matter what and searching for the problem reveals that everyone else with this phone is experiencing the same problem. I'm not sure if it’s a problem with the phone or Fitbit. Based on my research, both the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi share the same antenna on this phone. Anytime the phone is restarted, the Bluetooth is automatically disabled and has to be re-enabled.

Pros include a beautiful and large screen with small bezels, great performance, and premium build quality.

Cons include no NFC (used for mobile payments), no 5G Wi-Fi support, and Micro-USB instead of USB-C.

Sadly, I had to return the phone due to a lack of compatibility with my Fitbit Charge 2. My recommendation to anyone purchasing this phone is to test it with your Bluetooth devices before investing a significant amount of time configuring everything else.",Negatif
"I really wanted this phone to be my replacement. Sadly it couldn't handle my day to day tasks. This phone would lag really bad when it came to social Media (Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram). But the camera was really bad. At least for my unit it was. I would take photos with natural sunlight lighting and the images would still come out washed out. I was also having mic issues with mine. People on the other side of the phone said I sounded faint or far away from my phone. When in reality my head was next to the mic. I really wanted this phone to be my current phone. But it came with too many issues. I already requested a refund and received. I don't blame the phone or the manafacturer, because it's a mid-range phone not a high end phone. I really wanted to like this phone but I couldn't.",Negatif
"No long and terrible review like most of the dorks here. Here's the low down:
- Pretty screen
- Terrible wifi speed when Bluetooth is on
- The blue is sexy
- Fingerprint scanner FTW!!!

BOOM!!!",Positif
"Overall for the price, a great experience. The battery life is generous, the camera is completely fine in the daytime, and the daily experience is good. It runs all my social media, email, and work apps just fine. The screen is perfectly fine. I'd say that the phone is aggressive in how much it dims the screen at times. If you manually turn up the brightness, it is completely visible in direct sunlight. I would say to any prospective buyers, do some things to help yourself. The stock launcher has a setting to close apps as you lock the phone. Adjust ones you frequently use to stay open. I found that making them reload from the disk vs RAM makes a big difference with commonly used apps. Make sure to use a sd card and set it as the default storage location. For the first week it seemed extremely choppy. Now it's fine. I want to have to buy a flagship out of habit but honestly... I just don't need more phone than this for what I do.",Positif
"Very disapointed with this phone.
I did buy two phones and both have the same ""freeze"" problems two or three times daily.
I had the Huawei Mate 8 and then the Mate 9 and they are excellent phones but no this one.
My mistake changing the Oneplus 5T for this crap.",Negatif
"I ordered this phone direct from Huawei out of their Texas headquarters. Tried to order here @ Amazon but it’s been sold out. To be honest the phone feels like a real true premium build quality. The interface runs smooth and have no issues so far.

I bought my wife the Honor 6x for Christmas and was really surprised by the look and feel and it’s performance. So I waited for the Honor 7 to be released and so I got one. To be honest these are great quality phones. I use to be in a jump program with Tmobile where I traded in my device up 2 times a year, but I paid $150 a month for 2 phones lines and the ability to do this. I’ve had all the Samsung Notes, and one I phone 7 plus (I hated). So I know what a quality of phone experience is.

Since Tmobile made made it’s jump customers start paying $150-$250 down to upgrade I jumped ship and went to Metro PCS and bought my phones outright. I originally bought a Moto G5 Plus w/ Amazon bloatware which ran fine, and no issues. I wanted a premium feel phone. I believe I got that in this Honor 7x.

Don’t worry about the Government and the public ridicule of Huawei. They’ve been here for a long time in the US, also selling phones around the globe )3rd largest phone manufacture in the world). I phones and Galaxy phones are also built in China. As long as it’s a quality build I have no problem buying it. I rather pay $200 than $800-$1100. I’m looking forward to next year’s Honor 8x. Hopefully they’ll have 5ghz wifi in an update or in next years model.",Positif
"Swapped nano SIM chip from my Windows phone and inserted a new MicroSD chip before turning on and it a booted up just fine. Going from tiles to icons required a little learning curve but that too went smoothly. Loaded Outlook containing all my Contacts and Calendars. Down loaded numerous Apps from Google Play. Downloaded Alexa App and serveral IOT Apps with no usage problems at all. I use both Google and Bing as well as the Edge browser and the One Drive cloud if desired. Finger print scanner is fast but a dual security of a Pin number can be used too. When turning on the phone you have a choice to finger print scanner or tap the screen and input a Pin number. All in all, this phone is a great value. It did come with a clear flexible case in addition.",Positif
"We had an Honor 5x we grew tired of. I still went for the 6x and that pleased me enough to have my wife get a 7x when the Moto G5 sucked software wise. Man I'm jealous. Nice screen quality, lag not noticed as per the wife. Screen size is what WE like, we are both around 6 feet tall and have zero problems with the 6"" screens though this is just under that. We'd actually like a bigger screen but can't be so picky at this beautiful price.

I have concerns that Huawei is not loved by our government but... that concern is pretty vague considering so much of our stuff is made in China anyway. And I can't afford to be buying a LG or Samsung and still love myself. I have a Samsung tablet so what am I saying... Hah!

Love it. If they added some more color variations such as silver or rose gold they might look even more pimp and sell out all day every day. Maybe.",Positif
"Husband, logged into wife's account. I purchased this unlocked Huawei last week to replaced my LG. I've had an iPhone and Samsung in the past and all smartphones have their up's & downs. This being my first Huawei I was a little skeptical however the reviews provided me some encouragement. I really like the design and although not as wide as my LG, it still fit in my leather phone case, which is a personal ""perk' for me.
Setup was a cinch. The device instructions are EASY to understand. It took a while since I had a ton of information to move over (12g) but when the process was all done, the two phones practically mirrored one another. All my contacts, photos, etc were there. Fast! Did I mention fast?! A big difference from my LG, which I have no complaints over other than when the memory capped, it was DONE.
The Huawei is the most programmable phone I've had. You can set your preference on just about anything. My one negative on this and it may be operator error, is I can't seem to figure out how to set an individual text-tone. Ringtones, yes, but texting.....?
The Huawei has an ""easy eye"" feature that blocks out the blue light for easy reading. Wonderful addition! So much so that my wife, having a history of Migraines, purchased her own Huawei and it's on the way. This feature and the matte screen protector, I purchased, reduces the glare considerably. Another added feature I like is the dual sim. With this option I will be able to purchase a prepaid SIM card for when we travel outside of the U.S. on our vacations. No more adding the international plan or buying a cheap burn-phone when I get off the plane. This phone has a dual camera function and, for me, it takes great pics. I'm not a photographer so as long as what I snap is clear, I'm good.
Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Honor 7 to anyone.",Positif
"The phone itself is overall well made despite it's known flaws of lack of NFC, and 5g wifi support.

The real problem is with the Bluetooth and wifi being run simultaneously. As other reviews have noted this problem seems to be affecting all devices running the current os. Essentially with playing a podcast or Pandora thru your Bluetooth speakers and run a speedtest while on wifi, my network speed went down from 50mbps to 0.01. Pausing the music mid-song shoots the number back up again and vise versa.

I highly recommend people wait to purchase this phone until something as obvious as antenna power management is properly addressed. I really wanted to love this phone but unless there is a fix and soon, it will be on the return shipment next week.",Negatif
"May 17th, received the Oreo update a few days ago and now along with facial recognition, split screen multi-tasking and a host of other new features the whole phone is running faster and snappier. The 7x continues to blow my mind. I still can't get over this phone cost me $200. Huawei has got me as a customer for life. I would love an Honor View 10 but I just can't justify ditching this one. I mean how much better can it be?

Jan 2018. This is a wonderful phone. It's my second Huawei device (GX8) and I really appreciate everything about this phone. Basically you can boil down every review into; It runs and feels like a flagship phone except the 3D gaming performance is a bit average. That's it. If you don't play high end 3D games on your phone (Why would you, that's what a PC is for.) Then the Huawei Honor 7X is all the phone you will want. Especially if you slap in a 64GB SD card. BTW I really like the EMUI enhancements. It's kinda like Android plus. Mines black with a black Niilkin slim case, very cool and stealthy. For $200 it's absolutely ridiculous. Watch the reviews, they struggle to find bad things to say. This phone is an embarrassment to Samsung and Apple.",Positif
"My Honor 7x was bought directly from HonorUSA because only there I could buy a Valentine red phone. It's been a very good purchase over the past 9 months except for the USB port not always charging, and it wasn't simply dirty. I called Honor USA and they quickly agreed to repair my phone under warranty. The emailed shipping label allowed me to send the phone free UPS air on Friday afternoon to Fort Worth and to receive it back on Wednesday, five days later. The USB port has been replaced and functions properly. I suspect a new battery was also added because of the very slow discharge under my heavy usage. My phone even looks newer than the one I sent for repair.
The only problem was mine--I thought I backed up all my phone contents, including text messages, lists, and some photos not in the pictures folder. It turned out only my photos and videos were backed up by the Huawei system. So it has taken several hours to remedy my mistake, but my phone is now a clean rebuild.",Positif
"1. Terrible at switching WiFi connection.
2. WiFi connection drop frequently.
3. Poor network connection in Room.
4. Expected better picture quality from 16MP+ 2MP dual camera.",Negatif
"Had to replace my Galaxy S6 and thought I would try a less expensive phone. The Honor 7X is a great phone. The screen is bright and clear and the phone is very responsive. It works fine with my Bluetooth devices and GPS with Waze responds just fine. I've had no problems or lag with any of my apps. It does not have NFC, so no Google Pay, but not a deal breaker for me. If I want great pictures I have a camera, but the camera on the phone takes good pictures and the quality is fine. I have had this phone since they were first released and it's a purchase I would gladly make again.",Positif
"(READ UPDATES!)
First off, this is a fantastic budget phone. So good in fact that I will be writing this review as if the product is a flagship model, considering pros and cons in equal light.

PRO's
-Good resolution display (1080p)
-bright
-light, thin
-small bezels
-fingerprint sensor is lightning fast
-good camera
-easy to use UI
-comes with a decent case

CON's
-NEEDS MORE RAM! only has 3gb and it will slow down like crazy if you have more than a few windows open at one time (Huawai, if you read this review, this needs to by fixed like ASAP, at least offer a 4-8gb model, even if they are more pricey.)
-not the best viewing angles
-speaker isn't very good
-I have issues setting the wallpaper, every few days it resets the lockscreen for a few hours and then fixes itself (RESOLVED 8/16)
-can't get rid of google search bar on home screen (RESOLVED 8/16)

SO... SHOULD YOU BUY IT?
My answer would be that if you want to spend less that $300 on a phone then yes, buy it. It is a great phone even if it were priced much higher. In my eyes, it competes with the Iphone 6s (before they started slowing them down).

UPDATE 6/18: Noticing problems when using gps. Signal gets lost and has trouble reconnecting. Also the fingerprint sensor is having issues where it needs to be brushed off before it works. Sometimes even that fails. -1 star

UPDATE 8/19: GPS has completely stopped working at this point. -1 star

UPDATE 9/02: Fingerprint sensor works less that 50% of the time. Phone calls say ""Dialing"" for about 10-20 seconds before making a phone call. I really regret purchasing this phone, but at this point, it's too late. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE at this point.",Negatif
"Pros: it actually works. It has good battery life.

Cons: the fingerprint sensor isn't very good. It can only use 2GB of the 3GB ram. The touchscreen keyboard is sketchy, the swipe function is more miss than hit. The autocorrect is terrible. It drops wifi with no warning. The screen isn't optimised for apps, none work in full screen mode.",Negatif
"Great phone, had over a month and no probs, it's fast, never slowed down, handles anything I throw at it, call quality great, LTE and WiFi excellent, no probs. Display is ??, and the screen size is great, colours etc. Battery lasts two days with normal use and camera is great in daylight and good/ okish with night pics. The build is great, it's sleek and it don't look like no cheap handset. Lots of features and more than worth the price I paid. I bought the blue one and it looks ??. The loudspeaker is good, not the best tho, but with all other pros, it's a minor. I would recommend this Honor 7x to anyone.",Positif
"I don’t will be a put a large review this phone is good is fast but have 2 problems.
1 Bluetooth don’t connect with my sonata 2017 automatically every time I going to my car I need set up connection manually is very annoying.
2 screen is very good but smug with nothing all time I need clean for keep sharp.
I work for celular store I have a bunch of smartphones like iPhone X xiaomi mi a1 pixel 2 and more . This phone is good I can use this for my daily driver but is the connection trough Bluetooth in the car is important for you look other phone. Just for be clear I bought the red edition from honor website I recommend buy th phone from amazon because the return process from honor USA is very slow. I am still waiting for the rma and label from more than 12 hours.",Positif
"I absolutely love this phone! I was skeptical about buying it at first, because I have never ordered a phone online before. & I never thought I'd start by buying one off this app. but I am so glad I made this purchase. the camera's are good, the shipping starts fast & mine was delivered right on time. the battery life is AMAZING. I wake up at 7am every day, go to work for 8 hours & when I leave work my battery is only on 92% most days, sometimes it's higher! and then I don't have to charge it until I go to bed. I absolutely would recommend this phone to anyone! very good quality and great looking phone great for people on a budget or for people who just don't like paying $700+ for a good phone.",Positif
Damn near perfect $200 phone. I had a few glitches to work out but they were primarily a function of me ignoring the instructions. The camera is a little weak - but good enough for almost every use I have. An excellent $200 phone..Absolute best $200 phone I have ever seen or used.,Positif
"This is a nicely designed device. The screen is large and colors pop, the body is all metal, and the fingerprint sensor and camera are great. Unfortunately, after about a month of use, I can't recommend this. I don't use my device for gaming, just videos, email and social media. It has slowed down so horribly in the short time I've had it. Snapchat and Facebook regularly crash. Having more than an app or two open brings the speed to a crawl. This is the second phone I've purchased from Huawei, the first being the 5X, and neither have had great, or even good, performance. I'd try out the Moto G5S or something comparable. Overall, not worth the buy. Don't be fooled by the low price tag and fancy body.",Negatif
"Purchased an Honor Phone, Back separated from the screen. Huawei said is was my fault and would not honor a warranty after 7 months of ownership. The electronics still worked fine. What a joke! The Phone separated and then just got worse and worse. What crap.",Negatif
"The battery is amazing! It lasts all day I do use YouTube a lot, maybe 5 hours throughout the day. The pictures are horrible??why can't I send multiple pictures at a time? The sound for me is so bad because it's too low I love hearing music on my phone??. I did accidently dropped in my tub with water, it turned out fine ?? ??",Positif
"I had the phone for 3 weeks and I returned it. The design and the camera are good, the best is the battery but the phone crashes a lot if you use Bluetooth or the camera and it freezes with Spotify or games. I wouldn't recommend it.",Negatif
"Update/Edit: After the number of issues I've had with this phone I decided to do even more research on it, including checking benchmark scores. I wish I had done that first! This phone scores abysmally! Yes, it's a $200 phone and should not perform as well as a $500 phone... but keep in mind that you're taking a HUGE performance hit. (About 1/3 to 1/5 as fast as phones in the 400-500 dollar range.) If you have all the time in the world and don't care about performance of your phone or how long it takes to open apps, particularly the camera, then go ahead and waste your money on this.

Though, I will admit that this phone does have two pros. First, the screen is quite nice. The color reproduction is good, the brightness is reasonable (I can see it outside in all but the brightest conditions), and the resolution is quite pretty. Second (and lastly), It puts up with abuse. I have dented the back of the phone, through the case I have on it, and it still functions as good as ever (which is to say, sadly, still awful), and the screen is still intact. Which is unfortunate because I've been hoping to break it so I have an excuse to buy a new phone. Oh well. I went ahead and bought a Mi MIX 2s anyhow.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First off, I bought this off of hihonor.com - the manufacturer's website for their phones - because the phone was back ordered on Amazon for like a month.

Having said that... this phone is simply no good.

I wouldn't say I had high expectations for the phone necessarily (it's $200 after all), but I definitely didn't expect my streaming app to constantly stop or hiccup, whether on WiFi or 4G. I also didn't expect to have to wait 30 seconds or more for the camera to be ready to use, nor did I expect it to be inoperable once it was on the screen (pressing the shutter doesn't always work... sometimes it takes a LONG time to respond, sometimes it doesn't respond). Then when it does finally work the quality of pictures is subpar. Sorry, let me correct that, in full blazing daylight the pictures look great. Good color and great detail. I can see the individual strands of fur on my dogs. However, if there's a single cloud in the sky the pictures are awful. Heaven forbid you try to take night or indoor shots.

Another big issue is that the alarm app. doesn't work. I have no idea why... it just doesn't. I had to download a third party alarm app. to even use the alarm on the phone. I tested this multiple times and multiple ways (alarm vs. timer, overnight vs. a few minutes, etc.) and the alarm only sounds if, and only if, you manually turn the screen on while it should be going off. So, in other words, if you don't manually turn the screen on at 6AM when the alarm goes off, you'll never know it's going off. Yup! Fun stuff.

Want to turn down your phone? TOO BAD! This only lets you turn down the call volume a little bit. The lowest volume is still eardrum blastingly loud. I'm quite certain the 30 minute call I just had damaged my hearing. (Yes, this sounds like I'm being a bit dramatic but I assure you it's still very loud. And to top that off my supervisor speaks loudly, which is why I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME... but alas, the brilliant minds at Huawei apparently know what's better for my ears than me.)

Sadly I threw away the box just a couple of days ago, so now I can no longer send it back. So, basically, I'm out $200 unless I can sell it and recoup some of my losses.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE. Seriously. Cough up a little bit more and get a better phone. This is a shame because the V10 looks like it might be a solid phone, but due to the issues with this I simply won't ever buy it.",Negatif
Watch the youtube reviews. It is a great phone for the money. I switched from an iPhone 7 and haven't looked back. I love it.,Positif

It's fast it looks great and very affordable my only complaint is the launcher and the lack of rounded corners but you can easily change that with the Nova Launcher app and the rounded screen Corners Pro app but overall 10 out of 10 would buy from xiaomi again :),Positif

Good.,Positif
"Pros : beautiful screen
Cons : too slow:
* the camera takes forever to be ready, look dumb everytime I want to take a pic
* forget about using snapchat
* random freeze for all major applications : facebook, instagram, after 2 months now I'm used to put my phone with the screen on after clicking on an app and picking it up later like this I am not waiting for it to be ready
* I presume some China spyware is installed

Should cost 50$",Negatif
The phone is awesome for$200 and now since it has the 8.0 software update it's even better,Positif

With the latest Oreo update it becomes fast and responsive. Best phone at price.,Positif

"I received this phone 3 days ago and my god i felt cheated... The phone keeps freezing, overheats & Shutdown. I am very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews :( I just wish it was the phone i expect it to be according to the specs and review but guess what??? it isn't!!!!! I cant even use this phone to do anything because it runs very hot and constantly shuts down :(",Negatif
Yeetus,Positif
Absolute value for money..... The Honor 7X does not disappoint.,Positif
"I liked this phone but ended up returning it. Too many cons I couldn't get past even though I loved how the phone looked.
- lagged/froze often. Esp when googling or using Facebook
- camera delay. I'd often miss shots bc the camera would not launch quickly enough
- text/ mms issue. The msgs would not download automatically for some reason I cannot figure out.
Returned it and got a G5 plus which is corny but reliable.",Negatif
"First of all I bought this phone back in December directly from Honor's website.
Pros: Large fairly beautiful screen, very fast fingerprint sensor and a decent camera. Good build quality body.
Cons: The screen material feels like plastic not glass. The worst part of the phone is the EMUI skin they put over Android 7.1.1 is very laggy. I tried everything to get the phone to run smoothly, the software comes with a lot of tools to clear memory and it still didn't help. It seems that it's just EMUI that's buggy. For instance, Twitter was extremely annoying to use because as I scrolled it would randomly sense my scrolling as selecting and I would open a tweet, same occurred on YouTube where it would randomly select a video as I was scrolling. It happened when browsing the internet, basically anywhere. I tried changing the launcher but it did nothing to help the lag and random selecting.",Positif
"This phone indeed looks like a nice option! But be aware, I'll describe my 2 hour experience with it: just got it last week, I live outside US and need to pay shipping and taxes to get it (My cost increase)... Once with me, I must admit the phone looks nice and stylish, the screen resolution and ratio are super, the camera is mediocre but it is a $200 unit, I did the basic setup and began using it, after some seconds of inactivity it will turn OFF the screen as most phones do and here is where my issues began, I was not able to turn the screen ON again, only a forced restart will do the job.
I contacted Amazon for this issue and a technician helped me to do several factory resets and the phone did not fix the issue, we did both Soft Reset and attempted a Hard Reset (Phone never show the Recovery after several attempts, this is something unacceptable for an Android phone)... We were not able to fix it and my only option now is to sent it back to get a refund (I will need to pay shipping again).

All this problem makes me believe that Honor/Huawei is not a brad to trust, how can a device get into the market without proper quality assurance to validate the screen and Recovery are working fine?

My advice: look into another option and save your time and money.",Negatif
"all of my apps freeze. email, camera, photos, DJI go, work app, blue iris, whatever i throw at it. i upgraded from a $40 POS motorola phone and this 7X POS makes the cheap unlocked prepaid look awesome. a reboot clears it temporarily. i optimized it with some easy steps and still no go. i had this phone for less than 2 weeks, purchased directly from hujway store and it looks every day it looks more like its a waste of money. OS and all apps are up-to-date. next stop is a dumpster. spend your money elsewhere.",Negatif
"For $200 my expectations shouldn’t be high at all but this is just awful.

1) micro usb usb pathetic. It’s 2018
2) great size screen and aspect ratio but not responsive
3) the UI looks like an iPhone. This makes the UI look super cheap.
4) camera is decent but it’s no where near other budget devices like Motorola
5) it has 4GB of RAM but runs like it has 2. Super glitchy.

Don’t waste your money. Spend the extra couple bucks and either a moto G5 plus, essential phone or one plus 5T",Negatif
Bought this for my mom. She mostly browses articles and talks to family in Australia with viber app. Great phone. My mom has no complaints with it.,Positif
"Upon receipt, phone shape not as attractive as in photos. I also never expected it to be so big - a bit cumbersome. Someone else bought another Huawei just before mine and both surfaces crack after just one fall. I've owned other brands before and they were more durable.",Positif

"Works great , no issues. I have the honor 6x from last year and bought the Honor 7 for my wife for Christmas this year.

 Hola, soy miembro Prime de amazon.
El servicio al cliente es pésimo, poco cortes y para nada empáticos .
hace días compre el celular HUAWEI HONOR7x Black color, ya que en la descripción del producto mostraba que el honor 7x color negro tenia unas características especiales las cuales eran las mostradas en en la imagen y vídeo que acabo de subir, es decir, 4GB RAM Y 64GB ROM.
Cuando recibo el producto solo tiene 3gb Ram y 32gb Rom NO (4GB RAM Y MENOS 64GB ROM).
Cuando contacto al Customer Service me dicen que ellos ven todo bien y que no es como yo digo ya que no pueden ver la información DE 4GB RAM Y 64 ROM y que como máximo lo único que pueden hacer es una etiqueta de devolución donde yo debo correr con los cargos (gastos) de envió entre otros gastos ya que no estoy en estados unidos.
yo compro de forma frecuente utilizando la amazonApp Movil y el mismo día que compre el celular compre un Cover, protector de pantalla y una memoria MicroSD de 128GB todo eso para el teléfono honor 7x.
el Customer Service procedió ha enviarme una etiqueta de devolución sin yo solicitarla y luego cerro el Chat sin permitirme responderla..
En varios Chat les insistí a que verificaran la AppMovil y no me hicieron caso ya que yo en mi descontento busque varias personas y les pedí abrieran sus AppMovil y seleccionen el honor 7x black y a ellos les salia la misma información que a mi.

Les pregunte a uno de los de servicio al cliente si ellos están colocando publicidad engañosa a lo que respondían que no ven nada de lo que yo les estoy hablando y que me leyera las políticas de devolución para que devolviera el celular.",Negatif
To start with I purchased this phone on Prim Day and after I found out that I had paid more then if I had ordered it an any regular day. Then I found out the company does not offer an extended warranty. Customer service rep was very abrupt and did not offer much help. Quality of the phones functions were average. the thing that turned me off the most was that the screen was very fragile and broke very easy. Cost was prohibitive to have repaired. Cost me $200 for 5 months use. Purchase a phone from one of the more famous companies.,Negatif
"nice phone for the price, the camera is good, but the contrast is too high, maying everything look yellow, and if you lower it and restart it resets, along with 3rd party apps like ig cam the contrast is way too high.",Positif
"I love the looks and the speed. It has slots for 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM and 1 microSD. I chose the SD thinking that I could load many of my apps on the SD, freeing up RAM memory, but no such luck. On the other hand, I can load all of my photos, music and data on the 32 GB SD without slowing down the OS. The camera is awesome compared to my old Samsung and the screen is bright and sharp, though it flickers a bit sometimes....and it has spontaneously rebooted a couple of times like I believe most phones do. Importantly, online support has been great. All-in-all, despite the flaws noted, I LOVE IT and don't think you can match it anywhere for the price.",Positif
Awesome,Positif
Phone worked great for about five months then intermittently doesn't allow incoming calls to come through. Completely random. Incoming calls at different times from different phones randomly go directly to voicemail (I'm told). These calls don't even register on my call log. Also if my phone's been inactive for a bit and I make a call or send a text all of a sudden I'll get a bunch of texts pop up all at once. Trying to figure out how the warranty works. Very disappointed.,Negatif
Nice phone.. just as good as top name brands,Positif
"We now own 3. Incredible little phone for the price - the photos are great, the screen is super bright and colorful, everyone loves it.",Positif
"While there are some pretty cool features, I won't even address them because a few neato features are not worth the sheer frustration and mental anguish this phone causes me daily. I can't begin to postulate the number of times I have checked and rechecked settings that this device ignores at random. It just stops obeying the settings! Even when I know I haven't changed a thing, it just stops doing what I told it to do previously. I have done multiple searches for fixes to find that I'm doing everything right. It's the phone that's wrong.

For instance, this piece of crap has recently decided to stop alerting me when I get a text. I haven't changed a thing. It simply stopped notifying me. It doesn't even show up on the messaging icon when I open the phone. I have to go into messaging to see if there are any new texts. And this is after it stopped letting me see text and email previews on the lock screen. I have it set to show me previews, and it used to, but it just stopped doing so a few months ago and I can't make it start again. There are certain apps that I never EVER get notifications for. Not once. Even though I have never changed the settings that say ""yes, please notify me of anything at all"". I have done system updates. I have restarted the darn thing. I have tried it all.

I'm pretty sure this phone is a narcissistic sociopath. It does what it wants to regardless of my wants or needs and it changes it's mind on a whim without a care as to whom it hurts in the process.

I hate this GD phone.",Negatif
"This phone simply died after 7 months. I sent it in for warranty service, and they told me it had ""liquid damage."" Apparently there is an indicator that shows red if exposed to ""liquid"". However, Huawei support told me that simple vapor, even high humidity, can cause it to turn red! They acknowledged that (1) the phone is billed as water resistant, and (2) only ""liquid"" voids the warranty... but in the next breath told me that water vapor is considered liquid. Hence they will not honor the warranty. AVOID HUAWEI!",Negatif
love it everything works great.. good updates reliable phone and AMAZING CAMERA! everyone goes crazy over how good my camera is.,Positif
"I have had many Samsung phones S7, Note 3, etc. this by far stomps the competition.",Positif

Ok,Positif
"* UPDATE *

ALL MY FAULT. DROPPED IT ON CONCRETE WHILE NIGHT WALK WITH MY DOG. CRACKED MY SCREEN. DRATS! THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST LOW END$ PHONE I'VE EVER PURCHASED. tip: I gave up on included clear case ... Never a problem ... Of course until it is hard dropped. KEEP CLEAR CASE ON ALWAYS.

UPDATE NOV 29 2018
Still very happy with the phone. I'm not a gamer, but the old school quick games do LAD (Zuma - color balls streaming ... Really lags. Free game worked on all other lesser phones, but that I notice (but for me, I don't care).

BATTERY still surprised me how fast it recharges. Great battery life. THIS BRAND HAS FLAWLESS! FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION!
Speakers could be louder, but not a tech, music, game, photo person.

UPDATE: OCT 2, 2018
>> Compared to 6x THIS HONOR 7X HAS WAY WAY WAY! BETTER CELL SERVICE/CONNECTION WITH T-MOBILE. So much better (works everywhere in my home, but with 6x, had many indoor dead spots). Great regular phone w/T-.obile. upped to 5 stars.

First: I have had excellent experience with the HONOR phones, unlocked, no service plan, but pay as you go via T-mobile has saved me a fortune.

HONOR 7: WAS VERY WITH HONOR 6X but with all new smart phones, they start out fast, and between APP updates, New Apps for new needs (smart door bell for example) .. it was just too burden and needy for better processor & ram (and a new phone seems the only way to get the BLOAT WEAR that unknowingly get into your system, hide, and slow everything.

I especially liked the idea of the larger screen on the honor7 over the 6x.

1. DON'T GET TOO EXCITED FOR THE LARGER SCREEN:
- you can choose to apply or not to each Android app. It is just more vertical space & MOST Android Apps are made for the normal non extended screen. It adds no usable space for MOST APPS
>> But it does leave an unused horizontal portion, that just perfectly accommodates those ANNOYING SPAMMY ADD POP UPS THAT HAVE MOVING IMAGES (LIKE CHERIES FROM A SLOT MACHINE with flashing in a narrow but edge to edeg box about the size of an empty headline box for review headlines.

THUS ... THE SIZE INCREASE IS NEUTRAL TO ANNOYING AND REALLY IRRITATING WITH SOME OF THE POPUPS.

ALSO, ALL THE VIDEOS I HAVE, OR HAVE WATCHED STREAMING, ALSO ARE FORMATTED FOR THE NORMAL SIZE PHONE SCREEN, SO MOST FULL SCREEN VIDEO WATCHING HAS TO BLACK ""pillars"" on each side of the video screen.

2. HONOR HAS LONG HAD THE MOST AMAZING FINGERPRINT TECH. IT ALWAYS READ A PRINT, ANALYSES IT ISLNSTANTLY, AND THE PHONE UNLOCKS. (side note, try washing your hand in hot water, dry them and the finger print I'd picks up the natural slight swelling of skin to hot water& and will reject your fingerprint until fully dry and cooled back down. It sounds bad, I just just think it's interesting).

PERFORMANCE:
it will take some time before you can even try out it's performance. There is a major update to 8.0 I think, along with having to get, migrate, transfer or reload all you apps and all but a few require screen name and password with no auto fill, for app after app, after app.

ME: THERE WERE TWO TERRIBLE GLITCHES DURING SETUP (I don't know what caused it) but apps we're popping open and closed, while others piled up open and freezing the screen all touch sensors and can only reboot with the full 15 second undisturbed constant hold my the power button.
It seems like a so what, but there is no warning, you phone and setup seem in peril, and may happen again.

BUT IN THE 36 or so hours since it was fully charged, there was much greater speed of apps & the ability to have more open at once than my previous 6x.

I will update as It goes. It is thinner and sleaker than the 6x, but I don't use my phone as a fashion accessory.
(and no matter how you transfer apps ... There is always that AMAZON not being ""universal"" with apps not bought/downloaded from Amazon app store ... Which leads me to forget, you have to find the Amazon app store app itself via the chrome browser and not via the Amazon Shopping Store App(s) that may be there. I wish Amazon would give up on trying to get a kind of Monopoly on their apps store. Google has so far exceeded and dominates Android apps, Amazon will never get anything but loyal Amazon customers like myself, repeatedly annoyed & irritated when some app gets pissy because you removed any one of several Amazon specific apps (I use Amazon for everything, but I still don't need or use all the apps and services Amazon offers. (I am not a reader, and if I did want to read one of the hundred of Amazon book stored in Amazon's cloud (all free and collected over years when a freebee book showed up) because I am now over 50 years old ... And people, it's real ... All the sudden and really fast they get bad, and daily it seems my vision worsens .. so a phone would been too hard to read from ( if I ever did read).

I would NOT say to run away from this phone if considering it, but neither would I give a full thumbs up as there are things yet to learn)

AS FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION. THE UPGRADE TO 8 HAS IT. IT'S KINDA D STUPID USELESS. FIRST YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE POWER BUTTON TO TELL THE PHONE TO TURN ON CAM AND CHECK (WHICH IT DOES FAST) BUT THE FINGERPRINT ID IS SO MUCH FASTER. A LIGHT SWIPE ALERTS THE PHONE TO CHECK ID, WHICH IS INSTANT. THE FACIAL RECOGNITION TAKES STEPS ... AND THEN IT SHOWS YOU OWN PIC WHEN CONFIRMED. I AM NOT PHOTOGENIC AND A BAD SELFIE LOOKING AT ME WHEN I TURN MY PHONE ON EACH TIME IS NOT ENJOYABLE AT ALL)",Positif
"Before I bought this phone, I read about how terribly it lagged, how it takes forever to open an app and how incredibly frustrating it is when you are trying to do something. I went and bought it anyway, directly from the honor store. It worked well the first week, then I started noticing some lagging the second week. This is my third week of ownership and the negatives far outweighs any benefits this phone has.",Positif
"I needed the ""best bang for the $"" and after about a month of heavy online research and reviews I decided on this 7x...
I LOVE IT!
I do not require or want the new flagship device as I just do not use a phone enough to justify $1K on a phone but I wanted a good looking phone. I am happy to repot this phone looks like a very expensive phone! The huge 18:9 screen just shouts expensive!

I needed a good camera, I needed a minimum of 32 gb and a minimum 3 gb ram so this 7x delivers.
On my 1st day of using my phone ""more than normal"" as its new, I am at 57% at the end of the evening so looks like the battery life will be great for my normal use and will give me much more than a full day.

UPDATE: I have now had the phone a few weeks and with my light to average use ( I do not live on my phone) I noticed I was on day 3, 8 hours and still had a little battery left! So I know with how I use my phone, I will never be searching for a charger!

I am on t-mobil and happy to report the phone works well ( my other phones did not as I am in a bad t-mobil location) The voice over 4G does work and the voice quality is MUCH better than any phone I have used.

T-Mobil WiFi calling does not work with this phone. I have been using T-Mobil purchased phones with T-Mobil versions of Android and or iPhones but T-Mobil WIFI calling only works on iPhones and T-Mobil devices. After searching T-mobil does have a App ( T-Mobil DIGITS) That allows calling / texting via a internet connection so I expect the WIFI calling will be a non-issue for me. I did use WIFI calling the few times I vacation in the mountains with no cell signal but now that I have a Digits app I'm okay.

This phone wifi will only do 2.4 ghz, not 5.0 ghz but I have improved my home wifi with a mesh system and I find most hotspots around town use the 2.4. My phone is very fast however when I do a wifi speed test I do not get the speed I do with a 5.0 ghz phone but the 7X phone is actually a faster phone? I would like to see dual band WIFI and I considered another brand because of only 2.4 but the other brand at this price point did not have this beautiful screen size so I am very happy I purchased this phone.

When purchasing this phone I also wanted a case and a glass screen protector, These Amazon products fit PERFECT and love them as much as the phone! Huawei Honor 7X case, Yuanling [Shock Resistant] Carbon Fiber Soft TPU Brushed Texture Phone case Anti-fingerprint Flexible Full-body Protective Cover For Huawei Honor 7X smartphone (Blue)

This glass protector fits PERFECT with no bubbles and went on EZ, Best glass protector I have ever used so if you are buying the 7x, this is the one to buy!
[2 Pack]Huawei Honor 7X Screen Protector,Setber [Full Coverage][2.5D Arc Edges][9 Hardness][Anti-Scratch][Anti-fingerprint][HD Clear]Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Huawei Honor 7X -Blue

At this price point , My thoughts are with this grade of camera, battery life, edge to edge 18:9 screen ( makes phones with normal screens look ancient ) and the fact that it is reported the 7X will get the newest Android 8.0 Oreo, this phone is simply the phone to buy!
UPDATE: I have had this phone almost 1 year. I do love this phone. this is the only phone I have EVER used that has not locked up at least once on me! The operating system works PERFECT! The camera is much better than lots of more expensive phones. I own mega expensive pro cameras so I know! This phone camera may not be what is in a $1K phone but I would say almost! I like the camera, its looks fantastic.
Issues is using the phone in my home office. I have a new metal roof that blocks cell signal and I truly need Tmobil wifi calling. As I understand wifi calling is only on unlocked newer like 6+ iPhones or phones purchased from T-mobil so this phone can not do t-mobil wifi calling. I need this feature as I can't get good cell coverage at my home office. Tmobil has the digits app that somewhat helps but its a bummer I don't have wifi calling.
The lack of 5 ghz ( only 2.4 ghz ) makes for a slower wifi connection, not a deal breaker but on the new Honor phone its needs dual band wifi. needs to be USB c connector on the newer phone as well.
If you can live without wifi calling I still think this phone is the phone to buy! Almost a year and I still get 3+ days on a charge! Fantastic!",Positif
