"A quick bit of info. Between my wife and I we are currently using a Galaxy s8 and now this Huawei Mate se. We have been using the mate se for about 3 weeks now and feel confident in reviewing it.

For starters like a lot of Americans we were not familiar with the Huawei brand when we went to purchase a new phone to replace an older model phone. We spent the better part of three days comparing various phones from a variety of makers with the phones we knew best Samsung Galaxy series. After reading many reviews both on seller sites and in tech magazines we decided that for what they were selling for on amazon ($249.99) if the Huawei Mate se was as good as we were reading we couldn't go wrong

The phone we ordered was from a third party seller and they deserve some credit here after being quoted an arrival window of eight to ten days they got it to us in only four. So to bayshine store kudos to you on that one.

Just out the box the phone looked good reminiscent more of iPhones then Galaxies in my opinion,either way startup and set up were a breeze.

Now down to the brass tacks we have run several comparisons between this phone and our Samsung and honestly and I mean no disrespect to Samsung here this phone is almost on par with it. The few bells and whistles that this phone lacks are just that only bells and whistles. Just to point out some of our tests.
Browsing the internet

Playing games
Listening to music
Battery life
Watching videos
Camera Picture quality
Camera Video quality

Our results are surprising. In all of the categories except for camera picture/video quality the difference between them is almost moot the Samsung charges faster and has better low light picture and video capabilities.

The only complaints I have about the mate se is regarding such trivial things as downloading themes and backgrounds. Stuff of that nature. We found that we were unable to send gifs over mms when using the primary texting software and we had to get the messenger app from the app store. These are all small little nuisance issues and easy to adapt to especially considering the Huawei costs almost a third of what we paid for the s8 when we got it.

Now we don't feel confident to sit her and discuss the nuances of the specifications regarding this product but from a casual users perspective we could not be happier with Huawei's mate se phone. It is everything we need in a phone for an amazing price.

I would and do recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a great phone.

"Well, I am a very experienced Techie type and I was looking on Amazon for a 64 GB Internal storage with 256GB external SD Card Capabilities and close to 6 inch Android Unlocked Phone. Before I purchased this phone (in the Gold color), I read all the specs and made sure it would work with my AT&T LTE Data plan, Texting, Phone calls and also my home WiFi. And It works fine for my WiFi and Data needs.

*My goal in this review is to help you with your decision of whether or not to purchase this phone. Please note that this review reflects my personal opinions and experience with this phone.*

PROS:

1) 64GB of Internal Storage...however after the OS and Factory Apps, it had 51gb left. After I installed lots of personal Apps such as Word and Excel (free from Playstore) and several weather apps, Facebook, Twitter and Kindle, I have 46.84gb left. Plenty left if I want to install more apps or updates on apps.

2) 4G/LTE Data/Hot Spot Info. I have a ATT Data plan so I tested for 4G/LTE on an app and it verified that I have 4G/LTE. My LTE data is very fast and works perfectly when I out of a WI-FI area. The data hotspot worked great as I tested this on other devices.

3) Android OS---My phone arrived with Oreo 8.0 pre-installed. And it runs flawlessly!

4) WiFi and Bluetooth abilities: My WiFi Router is a ATT UVERSE 2Wire model (not a 5 Ghz). The WiFi connected immediately to this phone and it is a very fast WiFi, I tested the speed of the WiFi using an app WiFi Analyzer Pro, it tested at 72 mbps. So I am very pleased with this. Also, the WiFi is super strong and I receive 5 bars around my home and it keeps the strong connection even in my backyard.
* Bluetooth...So I setup a Bluetooth speaker and Bluetooth headset, both connected wonderfully to this phone.
I kept the Bluetooth speaker on and played music while WiFi was connected. Both did fine and my WiFi worked well and had a very strong signal.*
***If you later on buy a 5GHZ Router, make sure that is DUAL BAND and auto switchable to 2.4GHZ. Some of the higher end Routers have dual band/switchable 5GHZ/2.4GHZ. The newer, high end Routers auto switch ( make sure it is setup for this). This way it allow the 2.4GHZ Devices to connect to 2.4 GHZ band and the newer 5 GHZ devices can connect to the the 5 GHZ band. I have researched 5 GHZ/2.4 GHZ Routers thoroughly as I hope to purchase a new Dual band 2.4 GHZ/5 GHZ Router in a few months..this way, I can connect any device to the WIFI. However, right now my 2.4 GHZ AT&T Uverse Router is fast and my phone gets 4 bars of WIFI even in my large backyard, 2.4 GHZ band has a longer distance than the 5GHZ band. I prefer the 2.4 GHZ band over the 5 GHZ band because I need a longer distance because I am in a large house and need to connect to WIFI in any room I want to, even outside in my yard). And the 2.4 GHZ connects well with a great speed.

5) Display---The almost 6 inch (5.93 inch) display is very, very clear and colors vivid as it has 407 PPI sharpness, super sharp and the colors are vibrant! Reading on the Internet, Kindle book or PDF Book, the text is very crisp. The videos in YouTube are very clear as well.

6) Speed and Performance--I use Word, Excel, Facebook, Twitter, Internet, YouTube, Email, etc. I do not play games on this phone yet I found all videos run very well.
Performs well, no lagging and no freezing.

7) WiFi calling---Huawei does NOT have ACTUAL WIFI CALLING on this phone. I have a Google Hangouts account and Google assigned me a number. For me to call on WiFi, I use my GOOGLE VOICE PHONE NUMBER, which is different from my cellphone SIM CARD number. Note that I use Google Hangouts on my non cellular Tablet sometimes to make a ""WiFi"" phone call.

8) External Slot for SD Card---So I installed a SanDisk 128gb Micro SD card which was loaded with my music, pictures, home videos and files. I still have 75 gb left on my SD Card. According to Gsmarena, this device holds up to 256 GB Micro SD card.

9) Camera---I actually took some inside and outside pictures and saved them to my SD Card. The pictures (indoors and outdoors) are very clear, excellent for sending in email or even Facebook. My videos also came out well.

10) Battery life and Device Coolness---Battery life I find excellent and I am a heavy user of apps. I watch lots of YouTube videos, Facebook, listen to my music etc. My battery starts off at 100 percent, then after one hour of heavy use it shows close to 90 percent. So I am pleased.
***Device coolness/Battery coolness---The battery temp is usually at 77F to 86F, but after downloading say several books on my Kindle app, it will reach 95F, then go right back down to 86F. I use Battery Solo Widget free from the Playstore.

11) Printing documents on this phone. So I installed PrinterShare app from Playstore. Using the SHARE option in Word, Excel and many other apps, I print right from this phone as it prints on my HP Wireless printer. No need to get on my laptop to print!

12) Sound Clarity: I use 2 types of headsets, the wired type and the Bluetooth type. When I use a wired headset, it has good quality. And when I use my older Bluetooth headset it als o sounds great. Personally, I find the sound on this phone using a headset or Bluetooth speakers is excellent. And I listen to music, videos often with this phone. Also the phone call clarity is excellent as well, both on SPEAKERPHONE or using the phone by my ear.

13) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However it does have OTG (On the Go), which means with a USB/Micro adapter, you can insert a USB Flash drive, USB mouse, keyboard (one at a time). I use this to copy files from my Flash drive to my phone or vice versa).

Cons...Three cons:
1) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However, I was happy because I have several MICRO chargers. No need to buy a new Type C one as my spare charger.
2) NO 5GHZ WiFi receiver. Since I have an older router without 5ghz, this is not a problem for me. *If you have a 5ghz router, you may want to consider another phone that has 5ghz capabilities.
3) NO NFC...This I was aware of and I do not use this feature anyway. If you need to use NFC, then this phone would NOT be the best choice for you.

Note that I am rating this 4.5 stars, rounded off to 5 stars because this phone has 64gb internal, huge screen with superb clarity and this a beautiful phone that is reasonably priced, yet looks expensive.

Would I buy this phone again? Yes, because of the very large screen, 64gb internal space and great price.
***Thank you for reading my review. I hope that it has helped you in your decision of whether or not to purchase this phone.***
Since I am a techie type, ask me questions if you like.",Postif
"bought the GOLD version of this Huawei Mate SE for $229 + sales tax from here on amazon. as an iPhone person who recently turned to Huawei, this is a fabulous great phone from Huawei. my iPhone was flaking out because of apple's horrible battery shutdown/slowdown problems. apple jumped the shark trying to fool people about what was really happening with iPhone batteries. anyways, previously got a nice AT&T-branded Huawei Ascend XT2 which was like my training-wheels version to get me ready for this much more powerful unlocked Huawei Mate SE. Huawei got me hooked with its EMUI 5.1 (based on Android 7.0) that is designed to kinda be reminiscent of the iPhone iOS, particularly when you turn off the app drawer, but still a powerful android. so switching to the new Huawei Mate SE was easy peasy. and having 4GB RAM and 64GB storage really helped a lot to make the phone much more comfortable to use without worrying about lack of memory or lack of space. oh, in comparison, looking at the Huawei Honor 7x here on amazon, but for a little bit more in price, the Huawei Mate SE is the definite better buy. both the Huawei Honor 7x and the Huawei Mate SE look the same but the major difference is the Huawei Mate SE is more powerful with the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. and the Huawei Mate SE is available in a GOLD version. my preferred phone gold color version. yea! definite no brainer. got the Huawei Mate SE.

myself originally coming from iPhone, my suggestion to others regarding apps to make the transition in finding very good equivalent apps to iPhone's iMessages, Find My iPhone, and Find My Friends, is to go to the Google Play Store to download WhatsApp, Find My Device (from google), and Family Locator GPS Tracker (from Life360). and if you are like me thinking the android app drawer is a bit bothersome, well, you can turn it off in the settings on this Huawei phone. hopefully this advice should get you started if you want to have a more iphone-like experience on a Huawei phone.

my journey is complete moving from iPhone to android where this Huawei Mate SE has become my primary phone. using this phone on AT&T and have 4G LTE. the Wi-Fi is only regular 2.5GHz wifi -- without the 5GHz wifi option (the Huawei Ascend XT2 has both 2.5GHz wifi and 5GHz wifi) but that's just fine if all your WiFi access is mostly to regular 2.5GHz wifi wherever you go and wherever you happen to be. personally still carry an iPhone as a backup phone in my go bag, but this Huawei Mate SE is my main phone now. went through other android phones, then recently got the aforementioned Huawei Ascend XT2, and now have this absolutely beautiful gorgeous Huawei Mate SE. physically very iphone-like and almost similar to the iPhone 7+ with the metal body plus with the dual camera on the back in the top corner like on the iPhone 8+ and then with the more modern 18:9 size front screen like on the iPhone X but without the iPhoneX ugly notch. also this Huawei Mate SE has a real must-have earphone jack. and this absolutely beautiful powerful phone performs smoothly with no lag. and Huawei seems to be hinting that Android 8 and most likely a newer EMUI are on the way for this and other Huawei phones for sometime during March 2018 or whenever. [edit: Honor 7x beta testing Android 8 and EMUI 8 began March 15. with maybe possible full release in April? (because news also reports Honor India says April for official release.) Huawei Mate SE should presumedly also get the android8 upgrade in the same timeframe sometime soonish whenever thereabouts is my guess....] so this phone will get even better with huawei support. yes, this Huawei Mate SE is very satisfactory. very happy with this phone.

PS: people have commented in other reviews that if you turn on bluetooth, then the Wi-Fi slows down. this has particularly been reported in amazon reviews for the Honor 7x, and at least one other person mentioned it in a review here for the Huawei Mate SE. so, did a speed test to see what happens with my Huawei Mate SE on my home wifi internet: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had 47Mbps wifi internet speed; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had 31Mbps wifi internet speed. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is reportedly owned by Netflix). okay this is with an ARRIS TG2472G cable modem with built-in WiFi that can handle both 2.5GHz and 5GHz, but only 2.5GHz is relevant for the Huawei Mate SE, where my home internet is on the Cox Internet Preferred 100 Plan, and so my plan's internet speed can be as high as 100Mbps on the 5GHz side but typically half that on the 2.5GHz side. of course, we are only concerned with the 2.5GHz wifi. turning on bluetooth and getting 30+ Mbps wifi internet speed doesn't matter in a noticeable way to me on my home internet plan. however, if your home internet is much slower like on a basic starter plan with a maximum speed of 10Mbps or less, then proportionally any decreased wifi speed with bluetooth turned on could possibly be noticeable to you. sorry, if you are a big bluetooth user. me not use an android gear watch or bluetooth earphones. if you really don't use bluetooth, then keep the BT off and this issue won't matter to you when you are on wifi. but if you are out away from home trying to use free wifi which can be congested or which may have throttled speeds already, then this BT issue could affect you -- and so maybe just use cellular data in that situation if you really need your BT. personally, this BT issue is not a deal killer for me. this is a great phone imho.

PSS: okay maybe the bluetooth-wifi issue is a load of hooey. tried testing wifi internet speed with the bluetooth turned on while on the Wi-Fi at my parents' home where they have a DLink 2.5GHz wifi router and where my folks are on the Cox basic starter internet plan that has an advertised max speed of 10Mbps: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had wifi internet speeds of 9.8Mbps and 11Mbps; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had wifi internet speeds of 8.4Mbps and 10Mbps. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is owned by Netflix). it's like no difference whether bluetooth is turn on or off as to the effect on wifi. but other real life factors could be involved -- that's for any picky bluetooth users to test, such as also using their particular bluetooth devices, because at this point, this so-called bluetooth-wifi issue is a non-issue for me. but my guess is if there is any effect, then it's a combination of your wifi router and/or your bluetooth device(s). (yeah, have previously seen differences in using a bluetooth speaker on my macbook versus on my iphone.) in other words, YMMV. bottomline as far as the Huawei Mate SE goes, get the phone, and if you are like me then you'll most likely love the phone.

Another PS: (03/29/2018) just got the latest android security patch dated March 1, 2018 for the android 7 on this Huawei Mate SE. this is update version B130. it's not android 8 yet. comments elsewhere over on the xda-developer forum indicate that testing for android 8 (and also presumedly emui 8) on Huawei Mate SE may occur after testing is finished for the Honor7x. my guess at this point is to expect beta testing in April(?) or May(?) with official final distribution sometime soonish afterwards?? just have to wait and see. okay yeah would love to right now have android 8 (with treble to allow for more timely updates?), but this Huawei Mate SE, with android 7.0 and EMUI 5.1, plus with the latest android security update, is a very good reasonably up-to-date secure phone. my bottomline recommendation still stands to say this Huawei Mate SE is definitely a great phone very much worth getting.

Yet Another PS (04/17/2018): GSMARENA indicates that Huawei Honor 7x to get EMUI 8, based on Android 8, to officially roll out with final release in May 2018. so maybe beta testing of Android 8 & EMUI 8 for Huawei Mate SE will occur sometime thereafter? could be looking at June/July for official final release on Huawei Mate SE is my current guess?? we'll see.... meanwhile, me currently still very happy with my Huawei Mate SE. oh, an app tip for those who use their Huawei Mate SE in the car: if you need a car app for playing your music and handling your calls & texts while driving, myself using the DRIVEMODE free app (found in the google play store). imho, it's better than Android Auto. can activate & turn off Drivemode from notifications, and overlay Drivemode on top of the music app, plus easy swipes & taps to control my tunes, and big buttons for answering calls & texts as well as voice control to answer calls and to read/answer texts. (oh, with the overlay, you may want to fully increase screen brightness & turn off the eye comfort.) drivemode works great with my whatsapp also. and particularly, the bigger controls (swipe or tap anywhere on the screen) makes it easy to manage my music tunes while driving, kinda sorta like on my old iphone, but different & better on my Huawei Mate SE which is usually docked on the dashboard of my car when me out driving. hope you all are enjoying your Huawei Mate SE (or soon will be if you are looking to get one).

Still Yet Another PS (05/09/2018): there are discussion messages over on XDA-Developers that indicate an Over-The-Air update to Android 8.0 is being pushed out in batches to Huawei Mate SE. the batches are apparently randomly sent out and so you may not get it right away. still hasn't shown up on mine yet. sounds like minor changes, but have to wait to see. good luck and enjoy your Huawei Mate SE.

PS Update (May 11, 2018): finally got the Android 8.0 & EMUI 8.0 update. see attached picture. if you have a Huawei Mate SE, you should also be getting this update. yes, this is the phone worth getting. Thanks, Huawei! ADDENDUM: after updating to Android 8.0 (EMUI 8.0), some apps like Swarm, Yelp, weather apps, etc may not show maps inside those apps and may instead state an error message stuck on saying: Google Play Services are updating. you have to clear the data for Google Play Services in the settings app. Settings > Google > Location > Google Play services > Storage > and then clear both Cache (Clear Cache) and Data (Manage Data > Clear All Data) -- and that should fix the maps inside apps.",Postif
"Nothing even close to the overall quality, performance and features at this price point that I have found. Many people have written extensively about the features and pros/cons, so I'll just summarize my review with ratings based on what I think is a value at this price, with 10 being best value around. I don't have an iPhone 8 or X or Google Pixel to compare it to, but I do have an iPhone 6. These are my ratings after about 1 month of steady use:

Display: 8 - Not as good as the retina display, some barely visible pixellation on text, but images look great. Viewing at angle reveals limitations. The large size and small bezel make up for it.
Sound: 8 - Good quality for music, headphone output is detailed and powerful. Just a hint of hissiness on calls. Speakers are just OK.
Speed: 10 - The only thing that slows it down is resource intensive video games. Opening apps, running tasks are all lightning fast.
Build Quality: 10 - At least from the outside. Looks and feels very solid and well made. Buttons are responsive, connectors are solid.
Weight: 8 - It is a bit heavy for a phone of this size, but that seems to reflect the build quality rather than clunkiness.
Stability: 10 - No issues so far - I carry it around everywhere, no random sluggishness, no app freezes, etc. Boots up very fast.
Interface/GUI: 9 - The EMUI is good enough for what I need and I've arranged my apps for quick access.
Battery: 10 - This is where this phone really shines - I could probably go 3 days without charging under normal use, but I'm not a heavy user.
Bloat: 9 - There's not much extra stuff loaded and what is there can be turned off or ignored and doesn't seem to drain resources.
Fingerprint Sensor: 10 - If I could give this an 11 I would. I never thought a fingerprint sensor could add so much convenience but now I am spoiled. It makes the iPhone 6 sensor seem sluggish.
Camera: 9 - The resolution is very high, but the photos are just OK. Better than most phones at this price. Images tend to be somewhat grainy when zoomed. Seems that Huawei decided to go for max detail at the cost of a slight harshness to images. Camera is not very good in low light.
Memory/Storage: 10 - With 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, I've got plenty of room to load apps and handle the next version of Android OS.
WiFi/Bluetooth: 9 - WiFi seems fast enough and Bluetooth connected without issues to even my cheapest no-name devices, and remains stable.
Mobile Data and Phone: 9 - Get a solid 4-5 bars with T-Mobile in my area - at least as good as my iPhone, and remains stable. WiFi connection works well and is reliable. Maybe not the fasted around, but good enough.

Overall rating - 5 Stars
Summary: Best phone I have ever had at this price *by far*.",Postif
"I'm using this on AT&T in the USA, and it works great. It has possibly the best radio reception of any phone I've ever owned. I live in an area with spotty reception. With my old Samsung S4 and S5, it was about 50% odds whether the phone would ring, even if it was showing several bars. My next phone was a Moto X Pure, which would consistently ring as long as I was showing bars.

This Huawei does just as well as my Moto, maybe even a little better. So I'd say that it has a GREAT radio/antenna design.

This phone is awesome. It's blazing fast, has a great screen, great case, solid build quality. Huawei already has an Oreo update for this phone.

I was a little worried about whether I'd like the EMUI interface; I definitely prefer stock Android. And I was a little disappointed that they went with a non-stock dialer. I got so spoiled with the built-in spam alerts in the stock dialer. But aside from that, it's really not too bad. You can tell some stuff has been skinned, but it's not nearly as bloaty as I remember TouchWiz being on the Samsung.

Also most of the apps like facebook don't appear to be cooked into the ROM, because I was able to uninstall them (not just disable).

A few minor UX annoyances:
- They don't appear to have embraced the heads-up ring notification in their dialer...it's full screen even if the screen is on.
- They have an AWESOME built-in way to hide the control bar at the bottom, but no easy way to go full immersive and hide the status bar. (still halfway immersive is better than nothing)
- do not disturb - the status bar icon doesn't show any indication of *which* mode you're in (priority, alarm, total silence). Just shows the same crescent moon symbol for all. (The alarm icon will dim in total silence, if the alarm icon is visible...so that's what I use)
- 8.0 navigation dock - I get that the gestures are kinda cool, but this lost functionality from the 6.0 dock, which had a lock button. I wish they gave you the option to use the old style dock
- ""lock screen"" widget - works great if you use the stock home screen, but doesn't work if you replace the home screen (I like Nova better)

attaboys:
- this is the first phone that has showed my bluetooth headset battery level...that's awesome!
- came with a very nice TPU clear case...never seen that before!
- insanely good battery life...yesterday after 18 hours I was still at 70%

Warning: If you like root, I was a little surprised after I ordered this to see that Huawei was in the process of phasing out their bootloader unlock code service. I had checked this out when I was researching a few weeks back, but they just made this decision public on 25 May. What the heck! I was able to get my code, but website says in 60 days they will cease providing codes at all.

However even though I got my code, I actually haven't used it yet. I used to use root/xposed very heavily to tweak setup, but honestly with all they've done to allow for non-root tweaking in the last 3 versions of android, I've found there's really not much I actually need root for. I do miss my ad blocker a little bit, but it's a very minor thing, and I don't really have much ad-ware any more.

Also I discovered that you can do a lot of tweaking with SystemUI Tuner. (Huawei disabled the built-in android tuner, which you normally get to by long pressing the gear icon until it spins...but there are non-root apps that can provide very similar functionality. This is how I got full-immersive capability to hide the status bar)

All in all, definitely one of the best phones I've ever owned. And as for the CIA warnings...I don't know if the Chinese government is spying on my text messages...and I really don't care.",Postif
"Okay first of all let me get this out of the way. Do not worry about the chinese government spying on you lol Huawei is there to make money by selling phones, period. If you ask me I believe Samsung and apple had something to do with that spying rumor because they want to keep the competition down in America and Chinese phones pose a threat. After all why buy a phone for 1000 dollars when you can get one almost just as good for less than 300. So with that being said, this phone is amazing. Super fast fingerprint scanner, camera quality is amazing, if you handed this phone to someone who didn't know huawei, they would think you paid three times the amount that you actually did. I asked Huawei about a update to Android 8.0 and they said it is confirmed and should be released in April or May at the latest. The software is well optimized and I can get about 6 hours of screen on time with casual use such as calling, texting, and social media. You can zoom in the screen on apps to take advantage of the 5.9 inch screen. The speakers are not the loudest but the quality is good and clear. The audio through the headphones is really good and it also has a mode to improve it even further giving it a bit more bass. The only downside to me is it isn't USB type c, but with how great this phone is all the pros definitely make up for it having micro USB. With phones like this, from Huawei and xaomi, the days of paying 600 to 1200 for a good for are over.",Postif
"I'm not the techno phone geek many are but I demand a lot out of my mobile experience and this phone is more than up for it. It's fast, the battery seems to last forever -- haven't gone through a full charge in a day yet -- and my overall experience using it as a phone and a computer has been very good. The camera doesn't do well in low light, but the flash is adequate. Daylight pictures are exceptional. One feature I was meh about before purchasing was the finger print scanner and dang if it isn't the handiest thing ever. I've not had it fail and it gets me inside my phone fast. Flawless.

I'm older and have some vision issues, so I appreciate the large screen.

The phone was not loaded with bloatware and what few little apps I didn't want I was able to get rid of without a problem. I also have had no issue with any of my favorite apps working on this device.

I take all kinds of kidding at the brand and the jokes about being spied on by the Chinese are fun. But honestly I find all's fair in the marketplace and in my estimation this phone is a real winner. I've used Samsung Note 4 and Note 5's, an iphone, and plenty of Blackberry's in my time and this phone tops them all. Seriously a great piece of equipment and an exceptional buy.",Postif
"I've been on iPhone since before 3g. It's been my only smartphone OS I've ever known. With iPhone prices climbing every year I started to reevaluate my position. I saw Android users have so many phone options whereas my only options were, ""do I want a bigger screen?"" or ""do I want to buy an older phone?"" I did a lot of research and asked around and finally decided that I should switch.
The next part was the phone:
So many options. I was concerned that if I got a sub-standard phone, it would otherwise taint my evaluation of the Android OS. I was also concerned though that I would spend $600+ on a phone and I wouldn't windup liking Android. After more research I decided on this phone, the Huawei Mate SE (I still have to look at the phone for the spelling). My thoughts were that for this price point, I could evaluate the OS and if I didn't like it, I'm not out much after a phone resell and if I did like it, I'm not out much to buy a more mainstream Droid phone.
Thoughts on my purchase:
I love this phone. I am coming from an iPhone 6 and everything is phenomenally better. I'm sure I could have gotten a new iPhone __ and also had an improved experience but again, that costs a lot more $$ than I just spent here. I love the OS. There is a bit of a learning curve but after a couple of weeks, things make sense. The Android operating system offers so much more flexibility in it's settings and features. Things are in intuitive places so I am not digging through menu options to find things or having to use a search feature to find anything (coughcoughWindows10cough). I've have been keeping a Pros and Cons list and so far, most of my Cons are trivial things that even if I did use on iPhone, I don't mind them not being there for the sake of all the other Pros.
In Summary:
If you are not HEAVILY tied to all things Mac and are looking for a phone to test the waters of Android OS, this is your phone.
If you are tired of shelling out $500-800 for a phone that you feel the need to throw more money at for insurance/protection plans, this is your phone.
If you think that the ""notch"" in the front screen looks terrible and is a trend you hope fails, this is your phone.
If you want to buy a new phone that you don't have to finance like you're buying a car, this is definitely your phone.",Postif
Had the phone literally a month worked perfect! Amazing I was online with it.... then all of a sudden the screen goes green with two boxes on it red and blue doesn't wanna turn on or off nothing! Honest to god nothing happen to it I woke up and it was just like that outta no where! So I send it in to get repaired and they say they can't fix it because of bullying liquid damage but it was on my bad under my pillow no way there could be liquid damage!! They say the warranty won't work for liquid damage! So basically I'm out my money I saved up to buy this phone wasn't worth it!! Smfh,Negatif
"First impressions are really great. It's fast. Ample memory. Great battery. Nice camera. Got this phone for the kid, an upgrade from a much-beloved but no longer supported Amazon FirePhone (itself maligned for all the wrong reasons, a story for another day).

The camera has many features popular with the younger crowd (think: filters, background swap, beautify mode, AR ears etc). Android 7, while older, really doesn't bother me, since the latest security updates are available for this phone. We actually like the EMUI interface. May get another one for myself because it blows my older Note 4 out of the water.

If anything negative arises, I will update this review. For now... highly recommended.

PS Worried about spyware claims from US intelligence services and random senators? How interesting that most of these came about once Huawei surpassed Apple in terms of units sold worldwide. Politicized protectionist nonsense, if you ask me. I am really glad that Amazon didn't cave to the misinformation campaigns, unlike BestBuy, AT&T et al. I'm not buying another overpriced $900+ Apple/Sammy.",Postif
"Don't even hesitate. This is a great phone for the price. I have several phones from xiaomi, samsung, motorola and apple. This is at the top of the list. I like it even better than my mi a1. Don't listen to all the foolishness.",Postif
"Overall, it is a good phone,
The positives.
The phone is very responsive with no lag from touch to execution of command. The operations are smooth and the overall phone feels very solid. For the price, it is well worth it. There are a few bloatware apps that you cannot get rid of unless you root the phone, but they're easy to hide.

Negatives.
This phone does not play WMA files. I'm pretty frustrated about this because the Huawei website specifies WMA files are playable. However, I've uploaded several WMA files. When I check the file itself, it is on the phone, but when I go to play it through any player, the albums are empty. Moreover, the songs will not come up in song lists. Of course, when I load MP3s to the phone, it plays without a problem.

Other comments.
Note, this phone takes a Micro and a Nano SIM card. If you already have a MicroSD for extra memory, you need to get a nano SIM from your provider (or vice-versa). This isn't a negative, just an FYI.

EDIT: I am also concerned about the company's customer service as noted below by their response. They paid no attention to my complaint and instead, used this review as a way to piggyback more advertising.",Postif
"2018-06-23 Update:
The phone was sent back to me unfixed. On the letter it says the phone has been rooted and VOIDED THE WARRANTY. The phone has never been rooted and now after only two months I have a piece of junk.

Original Post:
Had the phone only for about two months. It went into this error state and would not even allow factory reset. Contacted support and the only way to fix is to send it back to reflash the firmware. This is so much trouble and losing usage of phone for a period of time.",Negatif
"I love this phone. Best ever. Long battery life, great camera, excellent screen resolution, and this phone is fast.
The Mate SE comes with Android 7. After I activated this phone, I was asked "" do I want to update the phone? "". I chose yes, it downloaded and installed the updates. After the update, it was now running Android 8.0. Wow! Nice surprise.
That's why I'm writing this review. While I was searching for the right phone, I was looking for a phone with Android 8. I settled for Android 7 anyway, considering that the Mate SE met or exceeded all of my other criteria.
I just wanted everybody to know, this is an Android 8 phone.
So, I say again, For the price, this Huawei Mate SE is The Best.
I highly recommend this phone.",Postif
"I've had this phone since March, previously owning a Honor 6x. I am very happy with it.

My usage isn't super heavy. I use Instagram, Youtube, Gmail and Google Chrome the most and all these function flawlessly. I take a lot of video / pictures and the camera quality is great. Low light is garbage, but for my needs it does exactly what I need and the price was right

PROS:
The cost is crazy cheap for what you get
Very snappy and responsive, unlike my Honor 6x which slowed down rapidly after first owning it
Nice build. Got a Spigen black rubber case for it and it is the first phone with a case that doesn't feel bulky.
Fingerprint scanner is wicked quick and the placement is great.

CONS:
Low light performance sucks on the camera, BUT in general it takes great photos and has tons of settings you can access.
Some slight software... not bugs... but quirks, if that makes sense. IE: You can swipe from the left across the screen to access extra camera settings, but only when taking a portrait. Landscape you cannot access the settings (as far as I know). Other built in apps have similar oddities, but it really does not bother me.

Overall I highly recommend this phone. For the price I think most people will be pleasantly surprised at the quality they get when they first use this phone. 5 stars.",Postif
"Bluetooth hell. It's a battle to get it to pair with anything. I had to fight to get it to pair with my truck and it won't pair with my car factory stereo.
Crap for Pandora, Spotify and I heart radio. While app plays from song to song the phone acts like it resets after each song. Starts the next song 8-10 seconds into the music, basically you miss the beginning of each song.

There is a banner that appears across the top of the screen that tells you that an app is using power, no matter what power level the device has left. You are unable to remove it, it comes on all the time. You have to wait 10 seconds to use your phone app.",Negatif
"I've been using this phone for 3 weeks, and am well pleased with it, especially as compared to my last phone, a Moto X Pure.

First, this one has a fingerprint reader, which is so fast and easy to use that I have finally elected to use a lock screen, whereas, in the past, I have been too lazy to want to deal with it.

Second, this phone has a much better battery than the Moto X had, even when that phone was new. The Moto battery became intolerable after 2 years; I hope to do better with this phone.

Third, this phone rarely gets very hot, whereas using the Moto was like having a heat pack strapped to my thigh.

On the downside, I cannot get Bluetooth on the Mate SE to connect with my 2015 Ford Transit, with the lower-level SYNC package. I am not certain this is the phone's fault, since the SYNC system has been sort of flaky. And, I am able to connect the Mate SE Bluetooth to my OBDII dongle. Fortunately the auto Bluetooth is not a deal-breaker for me, since I rarely used it, anyway.

Another deficit with the mate comes with the external speaker volume: it is only adequate if I'm in a small room with no background noise. The Moto X Pure had a great pair of external speakers.

The Mate's general image quality seems on par with the Moto, and the Mate has a lot more features that may be useful. The Wide Aperture mode is the one that gives artificial bokeh, and allows you to change where focus falls in a photo, even AFTER it's been shot. Test shots in this mode have been encouraging. The Pro Photo mode allows one to specify shutter speed and ISO, though the aperture is fixed at 2.2.

The Mate came with Android system 7, which I used for only a short time before allowing it to update to Android 8. Huawei's user interface is not pure Android, so some things do not appear in the menus that may be expected from reading about Android 8. For example, some of the new options for home screen settings do not seem to be available.

Coming from Android 6 I am not entirely pleased with this version of Android 8. It can be confusing to find settings that I want in the menu. The search function in the Settings menu is helpful, but some features just cannot be found with the terms I expect. I find the mobile data usage graph to be very much dumbed-down.

Some other reviewers have reported having problems with the phone's GPS. You must go into the Battery/Launch setting and make sure that each GPS app is set to allow running in the background. I'm no longer sure whether the default, per-app Auto setting, here, was the problem, or, if I had set some early restrictions myself. AND, the interface, here, can be pretty confusing as to what the default is, vs what you have set. But, it's all good, now.

I've also seen complaints about not being able to change the rather short screen dim and sleep time. Like me, people are going in right away and turning on the Battery power saving mode. But, in that mode, customizing the screen sleep time is unavailable. I finally abandoned use of that power saving mode. It doesn't help all that much. Really, the behind-the-scenes, full time battery savings over older versions of Android are commendable.

While I do not really consider myself a power user of smartphones, I did have to root my Moto X, in order to have unhindered use of hotspot tethering with my service provider. I did not want to go through rooting another phone, because it interferes so much with system update processes. Fortunately, the Mate does do hotspot tethering very well, for me. It did not appear to work at first, but one little change fixed it: I added "",dun"" (no quotes) to the APN Type of the Internet APN, under the Mobile Network settings.",Postif

"First off I never use the camera, so whatever on the picture quality.

I'm returning this device. In addition to mine slowly degrading with less than a month of use, guys this really isn't a great value. There are other smartphones out there that have better hardware at the same price. I'm not a phone guy, I'm a PC builder/enthusiast, so my interest is strictly hardware. This led me to buying this phone, until I realized I should've paid a BIT more attention to a few things.

-the Kirin processor is proprietary, this is cool but I don't like their software. Is full of bloatware and leaves me with 2.5 gigs of available system memory. I'd love good old vanilla Android but
-cant unlock the bootloader. I knew that starting off but didn't think memory management would be this bad and
-ITS LPDDR3 MEMORY!!!! Other phones in this area have ddr4 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUAWEI. Ddr3 memory is half the performance of ddr4 and twice the power consumption. It's especially noticeable in day to day use, bad
-oreo 8.1 doesn't run as stable as nougat

My reason for return is battery issues, thats just a lemon. I'm not accusing Huawei of installing crap batteries, in that Dept they are reliable as hell, but I'm not replacing the phone with another Huawei/honor. Because I want this review to be respected as honest, I will not recommend nor reveal what company I've decided to buy from this time. Honestly, this is not worth 200 dollars, do 10 minutes of real research (read/specs and compare don't just f*** watch YouTube) and then pick what's right for you. I think being more informed and educated would allow you to see that this phone is probably not what you really wanted in a 250 dollar phone, and you can certainly do better",Negatif
"This is a beautiful phone that is reasonably priced. It is hard to find maybe because of the current tariff issues with China. I was very happy I found one but after receiving it it couldn't see all of my networks even standing right next to the routers. I called their support and they couldn't' offer any suggestions other than a factory reset which I did to no avail. It saw all my neighbors' networks. It saw various service providers. My other devices saw all the networks. I tried it in 2 locations 2 different service providers and different brands of routers.Their support wanted me to send it in for repairs. The phone was one day old. I returned it to Amazon and asked for a replacement. They were very good about it and when I got the 2nd one It had the exact same problem. I have 5 networks. It saw 2 out of 4 in one location and none in the other. It saw my neighbors some of whom had similar equipment, bandwidth and service providers. I reluctantly sent the 2nd one back as well.",Postif
"My phone was working great for the most part since I purchased it in March-- no complaints. However, the most recent patch was forcibly loaded onto my phone(there was no confirmation it just restarted one day with the patch). That's fine except that now the phone dialer no longer works. After speaking with multiple representatives that made me reformat my phone time and time again, the solution is still not resolved.

There only solution is for me to mail in my phone and then wait 2-3 weeks for them to ""test it."" What am I supposed to do without a cell phone for 2-3 weeks? They offered no alternative, and I'm stuck lacking half the functionality of a phone(can't call anyone) and have a reformatted phone with no files or apps on it. Absolutely terrible!",Negatif
"Phone worked perfectly for a couple months. There was an emui update and now my texting is totally not working and the best fix I've been able to find is to do a full factory reset and I don't want to do that so I'm still looking for a solution. I love the phone otherwise and hope I can get this texting figured out.

Poi: the issue is that I can no longer receive MMS messages, neither picture not group and regular texts come delayed and in groups Tuesday put of order from how they were sent

Second update 11/23/2018 after three emui updates, the phone still does not pick up MMS messages and now it doesn't connect to Bluetooth anymore. Phone tried to be awesome but it's failed to deliver.",Negatif
"I've had the phone for a couple of weeks now and I love it. Fingerprint sensor is instantaneous, the phone is fast as heck, the camera takes incredible photos, the bluetooth has good range and is dependably stable. I bought another case but haven't even unpackaged it because I like the clear gel case that comes with it so much. Plenty of memory to keep everything snappy. And enough room to load more than I need. The price is unbeatable and I couldn't be happier with this phone. If there's a better phone in this price range I haven't seen it.",Postif
"Totally blown away....... I was going to buy a Samsung S9 and so glad I didn't pull the trigger. This phone has to be the biggest secret out there.

"So this is the 3rd or 4th phone I've ordered from Amazon lately. The first ones simply died/froze up all of a sudden. Just got this one a few days and it's operating OK so far. HOWEVER, I've discovered it doesn't support 5G Wifi, which I just assumed ALL phones did now. AND I just discovered it doesn't support Wifi calling, which, again, I thought ALL phones supported. So this means if I'm in an area where the cell coverage is weak, too bad. I can, and do, have an excellent Wifi router, which I could use to make Wifi calls with many, many other phones, but not this one. Back to the drawing board or, more likely, another retailer, and I am an AVID Amazon shopper. More lessons learned, the hard way..",Postif
"They want you to agree to give up all of your information to their company and affiliates in order to use their phone any way they want to and can change the terms at anytime and do whatever they want to with your information. There isn't any other way to bypass it. If you value your privacy, don't get this phone. It is amazing how many people have no problem trading their info for a cheaper phone. I had no idea they were going to do that when I bought this, but I'm returning the phone.",Negatif
"This is a great phone! Apps are fast, it's great at multitasking, and battery life is pretty good. Some things took a bit of tweaking to get right, which I never had to do on my Moto G phones, but now that it's setup more or less completely, it's just a pleasure to use. I got the gold color, love it, and the clear plastic case that came with it is really very good too. I also got Oreo 8.0 just about right away, against what the reviewers had said. The phone is a little bigger than I wanted, but it's really easy to handle and the back fingerprint reader is perfect. I highly recommend this phone!",Postif
"I upgraded from the Motorola Nexus 6 (2014). I wanted a phone with good specs that would be a significant upgrade, however I was not willing to pay the price of a laptop for a cellphone. I believe these Huawei phones represent an excellent value due to the current state of trade relations between the US and China. Because of political uncertainty, Huawei has had to alter their original plans of distributing their phones via popular US retailers like Best Buy. They are basically selling direct to consumer now. I'm guessing that Huawei probably has too much inventory on hand since the Best Buy deal fell through. Without marketing or any significant US brand-recognition, these phones are selling CHEAP. You might think there's something wrong with them... there's not. This is a great device! I'm considering buying a second one just to have as a backup. Huawei and Foxconn (Taiwan based manufacturer that handles a lot of the manufacturing for Apple) work closely together. I believe they even share some of the same factory space.

The phone takes two SIM cards at once, it's globally unlocked, and it doesn't come with too much Huawei customization to the stock Android experience. I disabled all the Huawei apps from receiving updates and changed the default preferences back to the Google apps. The only thing I wish this phone had is wireless charging, and that I can live without for a $200 iPhone clone. Oh, it uses regular USB instead of a lightning connector, and even has a standard headphone jack... image that!

Take my advice and give it a try, if you don't like it return it.",Postif
"Hi everyone, this is my first review EVER on Amazon but I figured it is worth the time. I recently purchased the Huawei Mate SE - first of all, it arrived earlier than expected so that was great. Once I received it, I noticed that the phone is just a tiny bit bigger than what I am usually used to but this is no biggy - you get used to it pretty fast. I ordered it in gold and I am loving it so far - the camera is very nice and takes great, crisp pictures. I honestly bought it because I wanted a phone with a larger memory, good camera and bokeh effect (lol). This is the first time I am purchasing a Huawei phone but the reviews on here and other websites really convinced me and so far, no regrets. I do have friends that own iPhones so I can say portrait mode isn't as perfect or fast as on iPhones but the pictures do turn out pretty nice once you get the hang of it. Let's bear in mind that this is a $220 phone vs a $900-$1,000 phone. Oh and BIG PLUS! The battery life really is AMAZING, it charges super fast, and not just because it is a brand new phone. The Huawei boasts its long-lasting battery charge in its latest phones, and I can definitely confirm :)

I hope this helps you make your decision - If I had had more budget, I would have gone with the Huawei Mate 9 or 10 Pro (with Leica cam and so forth) but I am so pleased with my purchase so far.",Postif
"the bad first...Lag, choppy graphics and freezes up for a few up to 30 seconds at a time when playing SOME games. and if you try to use a screen recorder when playing one of those games its 5x as bad and makes some games unplayable, on games that do not support the wider screen ratio that this has there is a black bar across the side of the screen right next to your game controls, and that would be fine except if you touch this black bar and when your hitting the touch screen game control's you are definitely going to hit this black bar and if you touch it, it will restart the game and put it into full screen mode which you cant play the game that game in anyways whoever though this was a good idea should be fired, for games that support the wide ratio you dont have this issue. When holding the phone sideways to play games or take video your fingers will often cover the microphone and speakers which is also a terrible design and you hear horrible sounds just from hour hand moving around near it when you play back the recording... i tried out the FM radio and not one, and i do mean not one station came in good, they all cut in and out and full of static.. i have a moto G4 which is not said to be a very good phone and it does have some issues butt its does not have any of these problems but it will disconnect from wifi occasionally causing issues for me on most all games i try to play if i am on wifi.. if it was not for that issue i would say the G4 is awesome... All these reviews are saying the mate SE is just as good as flag ship phones, i guess they are right and they are wrong, now the good stuff

The Good
for most games its good to very good, the phone is very quick and snappy in general use, it has lots of nice features you can turn on the phone like it counts my steps when i walk and it did that right out of the box and some other cool stuff i found in the settings and what not, seems to work great for calling people and texting, super long battery life (if not gaming allot) charges pretty fast for not supporting fast charging, plenty of storage, the camera is the best in low light i have seen in a phone so far and takes good photos, i have a DSLR and a bunch of lenses, it cant compare to that but if i need to get some photos in a pinch this is nice and does a pretty good job so far. your average person would probably love this thing. for the price i guess you cant complain too much.

now this thing is not as good as my old motoX pure edition phone, in some ways its not as good as my moto G4 and in other ways its way better than my G4, if it had a front facing speaker and mic and played all games equally well and did not have the weird side bar you do not want to touch when playing a game but its in a spot where your almost guaranteed to touch it (if the game does not support the wide aspect ratio) i would really love this phone i think",Postif
"I bought this phone because it has a legit specs under $250 price tag and it didn't disappoint indeed. The phone is impressive compare to samsung's pricy android phones. I've been a Samsung user for years and i would choose this phone over it. The reason I give this phone 4 stars out of 5 is, it doesn't support NFC, a tool for android pay which the latest Samsung phones have. Aside from that, I don't see any advantage the pricy Samsung Galaxy phones have over this great budget phone. Lastly, with regard about the spying allegations on it's makers, I think it's ridiculous! For sure the pricy competetors out there has a real reason to get nervous about how good this company from China make their phone with a budget price tag. Samsung's phone for example is 4x more expensive. Established company phone makers here in the US doesn't want this product getting noticed I think. Spying concerns? Come on! We all know they've been doing it for years already. It's about $ concerns in my opinion. Peace!",Postif
"The phone is fast. Pros: decent camera, nice UI (flashlight available with 1 swipe), fast enough with 8 cores (comparable to 630). Cons: It gets warm when using Skype, fonts might get too small to read.

I am not crazy about 18:9 aspect ratio. With that being said, other than the top part of phone getting warm during Skype, I have no issues. Netflix, Amazon Video all are ok. I have not tried any games so no idea how hot this thing can get or what it can do if you are into games. The Wifi does not come with 5Ghz.

Overall, it's a pretty decent phone, wish Huawei releases Android Oreo soon.

Negatives, I ordered the phone when it was 249.99 and now it is on sale for 229.99. I have asked if I could get a 20$ credit and the customer rep snickered and laughed. This is actually quite common which i do it at Costco. At that point, I have realized how little I meant, for a retail giant like Amazon. I'd suggest buying this phone from a merchant with a local presence so you are not stuck paying UPS shipping cost if you need to return it.",Postif
"Great phone for the money. This replaced an Axon 7 that I smashed in the door storage holder of a Ford Transit 250 when I closed the door I hear crunch! LOL, I have done it twice in two years. I hated the Axon 7 from day 1 - too many haunting stories about that thing - I am glad it broke in half. This Mate SE was a breeze to set up and I got an immediate upgrade to Android 8.0. Reused my Cricket SIM from the old phone and it fired right up without even calling Cricket. Google Play Apps installed quickly (45 of them), WiFi was self guided tutorial. Great pics, display. The only thing missing is dual front speakers but not a deal - sound is still good. Battery life is excellent the first four days of heavy usage. Also, for some reason, double tap screen to wake does not work on this model - again - no big deal for $$$.",Postif
"This is a pretty good phone. Does almost everything I need a smartphone for. I use my phone moderately for texting (WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack), checking emails, news, listening to music, uber and few other standard apps and there has been no lag or hanging issues with this phone. It has been pretty reliable.

Pros:
When I bought this phone, I had one important need - Good audio quality. I listen to a lot of music and the iPhone 7 I had before sounded terrible. There is no bass and music sounds pretty flat on the iPhone. I didn't want to spend $500-$700 on an LG phone just for the audio because their update cycle is bad. This phone has pretty good music output. I wouldn't call it the best, but it definitely sounds better than the iPhone 7 (I use Bose QC25 headphones).

I don't click too many pictures on my phone and whenever I need it, it does the job. If I really need to click pictures in the dark with bokeh and all that jazz, I would use an actual camera for that purpose and not rely on a phone. Don't care about selfies, so even if there was no front camera, I wouldn't notice.

The battery is terrific for my usage. With my regular usage with maps, music, YouTube etc, I end the day with almost 40% remaining. I have pushed the phone for 2 days straight on a single charge. I get about 5.5 - 6.5 hours of screen time on an average.

The fingerprint sensor is fast! I barely brush it and the phone is unlocked. I don't have to look at the screen to do it.

Also, this phone doesn't have the ugly notch on top and that's a huge +. I can't wait for the world to move on from the notch abomination and until then, this phone is a winner for the price.

Cons:
The screen is a bit too big for my liking. One handed usage is a bit of a pain. But I installed Nova Launcher and found some workarounds (swiping down on the screen for notifications etc).
The auto-brightness isn't accurate. It's usually calibrated to lower than what I would've liked. I'm constantly increasing the brightness.
The screen itself isn't the most beautiful screen, but that's not a major concern.
Doesn't have USB-C but again, never bothered me. I just swapped the lightning cable to the micro-usb cable next to my bed and I forgot about it. As long as the phone charges and holds the charge well, I don't care if it uses usb a b or c.

Bottom line: If you are budget conscious, need a phone that does the job, this would be a great buy.",Postif
"I was surprised and still get surprised every once in a while when I remember the fact that this phone is this price is insane to me. I use iphone and my 6s is breaking down, and instead of fixing my screen (which would cost as much as the phone) I decided to get a new phone. Problem is the new iphones are about to come out soon and I don't want a phone that's going to be outdated in 3 months. So instead I bought this phone as a temp phone and let me tell you, it is a quality phone. Maybe an upper-mid tier android. Some of the best money I ever spent.",Postif

"as soon as I opened it i put it side by side with my cheap $70 smart phone to compare browser speeds. not only did it not perform well, the wifi continuously cut on and off, forcing me to manually open the wifi settings and reconnected. also, the browser continuously crashed when loading pages. and on top of all of this, the person who packaged it must have been eating lunch while boxing it because there were greasy finger prints on the box. i assumed the phone would be brand new and factory fresh. returned it immediately.",Negatif
"I've had this phone for a few months now and it's great. Previously had a Nexus 6p which I loved but it finally got the dreaded bootloop. So I decided on this Huawei phone for a reasonable alternative to a $500+ phone and I'm very happy with it. It's on par with my old Nexus as far as performance and speed goes. Screen quality is great and nice and bright, it's got some nice features my Nexus didn't have. The operating system is a kind of a mix beetween Android and ios which is nice. The only complaint about this phone is there are some apps you cannot delete off the phones home screens which is kinda annoying but not a deal breaker at all, you get used to it. The other is that the photo quality isn't perfect usually, you have to really mess with the camera setting to get some real good pictures. Camera works great, I'm just very picky lol. But overall this phone was well worth the money spent and I would invest in the brand again without a doubt.",Postif
"I got say this phone far exceeds what I expected. If you're looking for a good priced phone this is it. They're some drawbacks no NFC but I can live with that.

"Well I've had this unit for about a month now and after getting used to the emui platform I'm happy to say that it has lived up to my expectations and above. Was a little quirky at first but seemed to adjust (me and the phone) after a week or so. The only problem I have with this phone is the audio. It just doesn't excel in the sound department. Not loud enough for my taste. The operating system is solid, and very fluid and pretty damn fast. I play several games and have not had any problems whatsoever. Face recognition works fairly well and as others have pointed out, the fingerprint scanner is awesomely accurate and fast. Battery lasts me about a day and a half with moderate usage. Pairs easily with all my Bluetooth devices. I'll tell you that I was sooo happy I bought a Spigen case for it, as I dropped it and it survived beautifully. This phone seems like it was built just for me. Looks classy, tall and lean but solid and sturdy and packs quite a punch (like me.) I am absolutely delighted with this device. I am coming from the moto g5 plus which is a good phone in its own right but the SE blows it away. The screen is vivid and colorful to me (and I am a pressman so I am chromatic by nature ). Perhaps an I phone or Samsung is better but $$$ is worth more to me than a better camera or OLED screen. By the way, the day and a half battery life is with brightness at max all the time. I'm sure you have read all the techie reviews and seen most all the you tube reviews as I did first, so my opinion is about overall value. This phone fits me like a glove. I turned my friend onto the moto g 5 plus and now he wants this phone. Research payed off multiple dividends on this purchase. Woway is my newest best friend.",Postif
"There are dozens upon dozens of reviews singing the praises of this phone, and I don't disagree with most of them nor will I repeat those accolades. But there are issues.

Bluetooth, generally:
I connected this phone via bluetooth on three devices: two car radios (factory Toyota, Pioneer AVH-270BT, Bose Soundsport headphones). It runs into two issues with all three devices:
1. The range is terrible. Get any further than a few feet from the paired device (e.g., putting the phone on the seat of the car, or leaving the phone on a desk and walking a few feet away) and the signal drops out.
2. It stops working after two days. It will connect, but you can't hear anything nor can anyone hear you (if you're attempting to make a phone call). Rebooting the phone fixes that issue.
(These issues also plagued my Huawei Honor 5x).

Bluetooth, in video messaging apps:
It doesn't work for Facebook messenger or Whatsapp. You can hear the dialing tone through the headset, but that's it. They can't hear you, you can't hear them. I have to disable/disconnect the bluetooth device to use video chat. Uninstalling / reinstalling the apps, factory resetting the phone - none of those things resolves that issue.

Bluetooth and Wifi:
You've read about this ad nauseum. I have issues with streaming music and web browsing - it (at least for me) prioritized the bluetooth stream over loading the webpage (which, I guess if I had to make a choice, I'd make that one).

Camera:
Terrible. It is perfectly serviceable if you have no intent to look at photos on anything other than on the phone itself. Printing photos or viewing them on higher resolution devices isn't advisable. You can make a pinhole camera that takes better photos.

Speaker:
Think of it as an earpiece on the bottom of the phone. Don't expect it to be a serviceable speakerphone anywhere except in a quiet room.

Screen:
Perfectly fine if the image or text is static. It has ghosting issues when you scroll or watch fast moving videos (e.g., football / basketball / hockey highlights). Brightness and colors are fine, though.

Included jelly case:
This case makes the phone more slippery than a wet bar of soap. I think Huawei intended for you to drop the phone repeatedly and upgrade to the Mate View 10. Sneaky, Huawei, very sneaky.

Okay, those are the negatives. Positives:

Android OS, EMUI: Oreo runs beautifully. It was actually a joy to use the device on a daily basis (outside of the above issues).

Headphone jack: 1. It exists. 2. It sounds fine for earbuds.

GPS: Surprisingly excellent. I've had no issues in the city or suburbs. Google Maps with the PIP works very well.

Fingerprint reader: surpasses everyone, including LG and Samsung.

Space: 64GB with a MicroSD slot? Good lord.

Battery: It can go nearly two days easily.

Device: classic iPhone style, copied by Huawei perfectly. Improves upon the iPhone design with the inclusion of a headphone jack. It looks like a premium device, and feels solid in your hand.

Call quality: Great. I used it on AT&T's network. No issues getting LTE coverage everywhere I normally received LTE coverage. Calls sounded good over BT (when it worked) and over the headset.",Postif
"I have this phone for about a month now and I can easily recommend you to get one. In fact, I liked so much that I bought the gold version for my younger brother. So far I haven't experienced any major lags or slowdowns. There will be some minor lags, but not so much that you'll really notice or get bothered by it. There are three things that you should consider when buying this phone which is the speaker, the ear speaker and there aren't that many good screen protectors and cases. The speaker is not that loud, but for $250 I can't complain. When making a call you might want to be in a quiet place. I found myself having trouble hearing the person, but the audio is clear. I've bought a few screen protectors and most of them don't fit or causes the rainbow edge effect. My advice is to not purchase any temper glass screen protectors for this phone.There are many cases but the quality isn't that great. Right now, I'm using this case https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794ZYN4D/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and although it doesn't have the best grip I like it a lot. It is a bit bulky but I like my phone to be a bit bulky so consider this when purchasing this case. Besides these three issues, this phone is fantastic and a major go. The screen is huge, the camera is decent but I don't use it that often, the phone is fast with no feelings of slowness, and the fingerprint sensor is usually accurate and really fast. So far $250 I think this is an absolute buy and a great deal. It is also said that it will be updated to Android 8.0 but don't quote me on this.",Postif
"Arrived on 12/31/2018 to replace my old phone which had broken.
Things I like:
1) Very simple setup once you enter Google credentials. It even copies over your application data
2) Beautiful phone, thin and sleek-looking. Huawei logo below the screen is understated and does not detract from the appearance
3) Comes with cheap, clear plastic case
4) Fast performance
5) Screen brightness and resolution are fine
6) The price (presently $219.99) seemed to give this unit the best value compared to other options considering all of the features (4GB RAM, 64GB storage), recent version of Android

Things I don't like:
1) With its 5.93"" screen, this is a large phone. It fits a pocket easily due to being thin, but the feel in the hand is not ideal. Unfortunately no one is making a quality phone with these specifications and a 5.2"" screen. Popsocket actually helps.
2) The Huawei company has been a subject of national security concern over the last year or so. Huawei has a Phone Clone application that you are encouraged to download to ease the setup of the device by copying data from your old phone. This works great, *but* you have to wonder if Huawei is keeping a copy of your data, hacking your password info, etc. based on the government issuing official statements that we should not buy Huawei phones. If I end up being hacked in the near future and they drain my bank account, I will be sure to update this review.",Postif
"I don't play a lot of games on my phone-just a couple of word games, don't stream movies, don't download big data, and don't take many pictures.
I do all of my banking, all of my reading-books, newspapers-everything on my phone
I text, message, and talk on my phone and use it for GPS maps.
I love, love, love this phone. It's light, sleek, good size, nice display, great speedy charging, and is very reliable. Never had it stuck, paused, or shut down during use.
I can't imagine a phone that would better meet my needs, not even for the $800-$1200 some people pay.
Doesn't get better than this.
And that nonsense about Chinese using these phones to steal from US
I checked on that at the reliable tech sources. None of them had any facts to back up that fear-mongering rhetoric.
So try one of these out.",Postif
"I have this phone for about a week. I could not have been more pleased. I had bought a Moto G6 and was not pleased with it. I figured I would try this one.
My criteria were 1) Less than $250, 2)3GB RAM and 3) 64GB or disk space, and of course an overnight charge that can last a day. This phone more than met those. Actually had 4GB of RAM (better than the G6), was less than $250 and I charge it once every 2 or 3 days. The picture quality is amazing. The speed is blazing fast.
I am not the kind of paying 1K for a fancy phone, yet I do consider this phone as quite fancy. I doubt these fancy phones have bells and whistles that can justify the price differences. The only thing I can't really speak about is the camera. I don't use my phone for pictures. If this is something big for you, then I would research this a bit more. For me a phone is a phone, not a camera. Still it does make excellent pics and nice movies. I use my phone a lot, and it does wonderfully well in every aspect.
The only thing that bothered me when I was looking for a phone is that it come with Android 7. As soon as I turned it on, it updated to android 8. So nothing to be bothered about anymore.
Highly, highly recommend.",Postif
"I bought a Huawei Mate SE cell phone from Amazon.com last May, unfortunately only a few months later it failed to work suddenly without any noticeable signs. We sent the cell phone to a cell phone repair shop for diagnosis and repair and were told that they could not repair it because the motherboard had problems so we had to contact the manufacturer. After contacting Huawei Technical Support USA, we sent the device to Huawei repair center. Surprisingly they sent it back to me and mentioned that my cell phone had water damage, and that I cannot get it repaired since water damage void warranty. In fact, this was false as the cell phone was absolutely not in contact with any water, how can it been damaged by water? Furthermore, Huaweis support team sent a falsified image of my phone with the incorrect IMEI number as proof of liquid damage which was not of my phone. I feel cheated by the company not just from its defective phone but also its deceptive support.",Negatif
"OK - yes this is a 'cheap Chinese phone', but it is fast, has a good feel, and plenty of battery life for the way I use it.
It also cam with a minimal amount of blot ware, which is a huge plus! Yes, it probably has spyware installed, many phones do, but I am not stupid enough to have private information on my phone. Duh!
The 4 GB of RAM, and the built-in 64 GB of storage is more than I'm likely to need, but if I do need more then the 128 GB micro SD card I installed has that covered.
With my previous phone (BLU), if I tried to listen to music on my BT headset with the phone in my pocket, it would drop in and out frequently. With this phone I have a solid connection all the time, including up to 20 feet away from the phone. Sweet!
The camera takes sharp, clear pictures. No it does not have image stabilization - darn it (grin) but I am satisfied with what it does. Give them 2 years and I bet they will have that covered as well.
The screen is sharp and clear and I can comfortably watch movies or read for hours without fatigue. A real plus!",Postif
"My GPS stopped working and when I sent it in for repair, I received a notice indicating it had been damaged by liquid. The phone has never sustained any damage by liquid.",Negatif
"Amazing phone for the money

I was a little skeptical about buying this phone but it is great. I had a top brand phone that cost 600 two years ago. You still cant buy that phone for less and this phone and it has more storage and processing power and a bigger screen plus its unlocked so you can take it to any GSM cell company. I chose Consumer cellular which has at&t and t--mobile service for half the price.",Postif
I will start out by saying that the phone itself is a great phone with many features for a budget phone. The downfall is that the phone wasn't unlocked as promised. When I tried to activate the phone with my current carrier they informed me that the phone was not unlocked. So something that should have taken only about 15 or at the most 30 minutes took 2 hours to complete in the store and then an additional hour to program. To say the least it was an very long day and I had plenty of time to work on patience.,Postif
"Initial Review: (1 star) Battery Failure (effectively bricked)
OK, I don't hate it, it it a GREAT phone when it was working, just like my Honor 8. It would run logged into Google & FB on Wifi for 4 days and still have 60% battery remaining! But after a few charges, the phone went dead. Does not respond to the supplied charger or any other charger or cable. Since I did not want to do battery surgery on such a beautifully packaged/fit device & it is a gift, I opted to return it and since I did not see any similar battery failure complaints I will try a 2nd one and update the review.

UPDATE: (4 star) - So far so good with replacement unit. I set it up and gifted to good old Mom and she loves it over her old tier 1 Samsung cheapo trial phone. It's fast, long life and a great camera compared to what she was used to, and MUCH easier to see the big screen for her.",Postif
"Adobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.
Install Flash Player
...Yeah I know I said that about the Kata M4
But I think the Huawei Mate SE stole that title.
FYI this phone is known by other names.
Honor 7X and Nova 2 Lite.
Pros.
The battery life.
I can see why tech reviewers on YouTube have waxed poetic about it. Don't believe me? Please see my screen shot.

Build quality.
It's solid and clean. Nice metal back with a smooth glass screen. The camera lenses is glass too.

The OS.
I normally like stock Android better but Hauwei's EMUI has won me over.
It's super easy to customize without rooting/jailbreaking.
It's fast and intuitive.

It has Micro SD card support.
This makes me happy because I keep most of my music, pics and videos on a micro SD card.

It has OTG support.
OTG means On The Go. I can connect a USB thumb drive, keyboard or a mouse.
See my screen shot.

WiFi
It can be used as Mobile hotspot or a router bridge/extender. Best of all, it's done natively, no need to download an app.
VPN is also natively supported.
Doing stuff like web browsing, shopping or email is fast.

Processing Power and RAM.
It's got 8 core processors and four gigs of RAM. It handles multi tasking like a champ.
So far I haven't noticed much lag.

Temperature management.
Pretty solid in my book.
I keep my phone in a case.
So far I haven't noticed the phone getting hot while charging, using and being in the case at the same time. The charger doesn't even get warn.

It has a regular radio. No need for a subscription or internet connection.

GPS. No complaints. I tested it by looking up my job's location.

OK Google ( AI assistant.)
It works well enough for me. I tested it by asking ""Who played the Goblin King in Jim Henson's Labyrinth?""
Not only did it understand me, it gave the correct answer! David Bowie
(If you have a speech issue or a thick accent then you may be better off typing your inquiry.)

The finger print scanner.
This is another thing that YouTube tech reviewers have waxed poetic about.
It's very erganimicaly placed at the back.
It doesn't get in the way of the camera.
More importantly it's fast and accurate.

It has a gyroscope.
It can accurately track your steps. Even if you put the phone in a purse Very handy if you're trying to get fit.
Works well with Pokemon GO too.

Time.
The clock is accurate. Heck I've used the timer function for baking. It rang when it was supposed to and my blueberry muffins didn't burn.

Multi tasking.
Remember Picture in Picture by Magnavox?
Lol this phone can do that too.
App Twin .You can be logged into two Facebook or two Twitter accounts at the same time! You know businesses in the front, party in the back! You'll need to turn this on in the settings.

Display.
Nice and sharp! I keep my brightness level around 40% and have the auto brightness adjusting turned on. I also have the eye comfort option turned on. My eyes say thank you Huawei!
Videos, art photos and text look good to me.

Accessories.
This phone came with a case. Do iPhones come with a case?
If you don't like the one that came with it then there are other options. If you can't find one for the Mate SE, just get the Honor 7X/Nova 2 Lite cases. Like I said before, same phone just different names.

And since it has a headphone jack, any headphone, earbuds or wired speaker will work with this phone.

Headphone jack!
A thin $230 phone has a headphone jack, imagine that!

The microphone.
I tested it by making an audio note and calling a friend for a ride. My buddy said he heard me just fine.

Accessibility.
Fingerprint to scroll.
Smile or use victory/peace sign to take pics.
Flip over to mute calls, notifications, alrms
ect.
Love it!

Predictive text.
OMG. I'm terrible at typing. If it wasn't for this option, you wouldn't be able to read this review.

Built in emojis!
Lots of cute ones to choose from like cherry blossoms, cats, and fruits.
If you like texting with emojis then this is the phone for you!

Now for the meh. Meaning not good but not bad.

This phone does come with a bit of bloatware. But I actually do use some of them.
It has one speaker on the bottom right corner.
Sound quality can get a little tiny on high volume. If you are holding your phone in landscape mode then you might accidentally cover the speaker. But look on the bright side, at least it's not at the back

Camera. The rear one has an LED flash but the front doesn't. If you want to take a good selfie you'll have to use the rear camera or find a location with good lighting.
There is no image stabilization on either camera. But you can compensate for that by using a tripod or selfie stick with a gimbal. Or just lean on something. Or just edit any blurrness and shaking in post production.
I took a few sample shots.

Charging.
It's not super fast but not too slow either.
The way the OS manages battery consumption makes up for this in my opinion. It takes about 2 hours to go from 0 to 100.
No wireless charging due to the metal back.
The charger port is not type C. This may bother some but not me. I'm fine with that because I can still use my OTG dongles.

Bluetooth connection can be a little spotty at times but it maybe the fact that my other phone is broken. I'll update this part later.

The phone supports dual SIM cards.
SIM card slot one supports 2G,3G and 4G speeds but slot two only works on 2G.
And you can not be using both at the same time.
If you were planning on using this phone for business and personal calls, you might want to look elsewhere. Anyway I bet most folks would rather use the second slot for the Micro SD card.

Cons.
NO NFC or Hot Knot support. Just a little FYI. That means no Google Pay or transferring files by touching screens together.

Pre installed apps can not be deleted or moved to the SD card unless you root/jailbreak.

Battery is not removable, unless you have the tools and skills.

Final thoughts
Please give this phone and Huawei a chance.
This phone looks and feels luxurious. One lady on YouTube even thought this was a $1,500 phone? LMAO.

Don't believe everything that the government is spewing. They say the Chinese government is using this phone to spy on us.
Not sure how dust and water resistant this thing is. OR drop damage ressistant. I'm too chicken to test that. If I ever do drop it down some stairs or in the sink, I'll let you know.",Postif
"I have purchased a few of these...they are excellent phones that run Oreo with Huawei skin. The build quality, display, and battery life are very, very good. I don't care about NFC, so this phone does everything I need it to do. It is very responsive and the battery does not get hot (like my old iPhone). I have dropped mine twice...once very hard...and it was fine. The Huawei skin is a little Apple like, but not in a bad way. Paying $230 makes a lot more sense then $700-$1200 for an iPhone. I use Cricket and it seems to play very well with ATT/Cricket.",Postif
"I'm a tech-savvy Galaxy Note 4 owner, and I've wrestled with buying an upgrade for months, ever since AT&T pushed Android 6.0.1 on me last year, my beloved Note4 has been unstable, cranky, and crashy. I had looked at the Note 8, and I didn't like the price tag approaching $1000. I also didn't like the Samsung treatment of Android 7. So I kept looking. The downside of other non Galaxy-note phones was they didn't have all features, but I could come close. This Huawei Mate SE is the closest I found to the Samsung S8, S8+, and Note8.in terms of specs and features.

And still, I was hesitant, because the Note4 had become a trusted friend over the years, even though it was suffering from unreliability.

After getting the Huawei Mate SE, all that worry went out the window. The Mate SE is SPECTACULAR.

Setup was a breeze, migration of my data, apps, etc from my Note4 using the Phone Clone software in the SE was flawless (of course it is smart and didn't move apps that weren't compatible) and moving everything took less than 45 minutes. The heart and soul of my Note4 is now in my Huawei Mate SE. And wow, does it ever work great!

PROS:
Fast - browsing, scrolling, app launching, everything is super fast compared to my Note4. Octacore processor
Good screen- easily readable, fast response auto-brightness control, crisp and colorful AMOLED
Fingerprint reader - placed properly, instant unlock, integration with some apps in lieu of password,seems to never fail
Dual SIM cards - one for work phone# one for personal#
Storage - 64 GB and 4GB RAM same as Galaxy S8/S9
Great camera - almost as high end as S8/S9 with HDR, time lapse, slo-mo and audio control
Superior reception - added two bars in most every location using same provider
WiFi Hotspot - works great where previously wouldn't on same provider.
HUGE battery - 3340mAh - S8 has only 3000 mAh - S8+ 3500mAh
Overall experience is like a Galaxy S8/S9 - minus the Bixby annoyance
Figured out a way to make it take notes like Note4/Note8
Supports ""Bring Your own Phone"" SIMs for all major carriers. I'm using AT&T
Comes with a clear protector case
Price - a $800-1000 class phone for $250 - DEAL!

CONS:
No Gorilla Glass screen - tough glass but get a screen protector for $10
No water resistance like the S8/S9
Bluetooth seems to be limited to one connection at a time - not a big deal, worked with my Dodge UConnect just fine
Screen res 2160x1080 where S8/S9 has 2960x1440, but this made text easier to read for me, so maybe a plus.
Rear camera doesn't do as well in low-light conditions as Samsung
LED status indicator on top right is a little small for my tastes
No wireless or fast charging - but charging still faster than my Note4

There was some news recently about the U.S. Government flagging this phone (and other Chinese mfgs of phones) as having spyware embedded. AT&T was going to offer this phone in their line, and pulled out at the last minute because of this. This was a political move, not a technical one, because the Feds wanted to protect Korean mfr Samsung at this time of historic North-South Korea reconciliation. I ran Norton, Kapersky, Malwarebytes, and a others on my stock boot-up of the Huawei Mate SE and found nothing. This claim is just political BS and even the U.S report doesn't say the actually found any, only that it is ""possible""

In summary: after months of searching, I'm pretty happy with this phone, and I'm glad I bought it. Can't beat it for the price. If you want a good modern phone without all the extra price and bling features, this is it. Copy/paste in browser to buy and give me a small tip: https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-Factory-Unlocked-5-93/dp/B0791VS3N9/ref=sr_1_3?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&tag=wattsupwithth-20",Postif
"Battery on this phone was bad. Less than a month and when went to sleep had half charge. Phone not used, but battery out by morning. Contacted company through Amazon and their solution was for me to send in the phone for servicing. 2 weeks to a month with no phone. Suggested that I speak to my phone company about a ""loaner"" phone. No companies would ever issue a loaner phone, so not sure what that was about. The camera was great which earned the extra star. Sent this phone back and will never buy this brand again.",Negatif
"Taking nasty ugly photos. If you are camera lover. Don't buy this. My friend have Huawei ascend xt2, it takes beautiful photos and videos. He bought as a deal of 40 dollars in Thanksgiving. After seeing his Huawei ascend xt2, I thought higher end of Huawei mate se will be pretty good for camera, also by seeing reviews in Amazon. Those who gave good reviews must be for the slim and sleek shiny look of the phone, but definitely not for the camera. Worst phone for camera I have ever seen and also screen brightness is not good. Huawei ascend xt2 is much much worth than this phone.",Negatif
"I popped in my Tracfone SIM card, there you go, 4G LTE! I had troubles with other international stocks, not this one. Excellent build quality, blazing fast 2.4 GHz processor, ample storage space, smooth sound, user friendly and beautiful EMUI 5.0..... most impressive of all, the camera! See the snow scenes I took. I say the camera itself worthy the $229 I paid for! I LOVE IT! I can not believe a flagship phone costs this low! The casing feels lighter than the Mate 10 Pro, which costs much more. That is perfect for me. I strongly recommend the phone, to those can not bear infinite OS upgrades, just to welcome more bugs, and cheap tricks that slow down their devices. Good job, Huawei!",Postif
"I have been using this phone for a month on T-Mobile and have had no issues with it. Its a solid phone and it was worth the $200 I paid for it. Its fast and has a good quality build with a bright screen and the OS is pleasant. And news flash, every country is spying on you and you use facebook, so I think the hype about privacy issues with Huawei is overblown, unsubstantiated, and shouldn't factor into your decision when buying this phone.",Postif
"Overall, very impressed with what was done with my 229.99. Some subtle lag after the initial launch. However, the security update seems to have mitigated this issue. Construction quality also superb, metal finish seemingly premium. Unlikely to find a better deal for a smartphone of this price at this point in time. Hopefully, Huawei continues their line of budget smartphones, unlike many other companies.",Postif
"I've used the phone now about a month and can adequately give my 2cents. The phone is amazing (and for under $220). The camera is fantastic. The battery is a workhorse in longevity. The speaker is adequate. All the standard android apps are pre-installed. Navigation is very easy if you are familiar with Android interface. I have owned the Huawei Honor 8 phone for about 2 years prior to this one, but was looking for something with more internal storage (64GB), bigger display. The phone hits all the buttons.

The only criticism is the ""Micro-USB"" charging port, cable. I would rather had this phone been built with a ""Type-C"" port. The phone charges much slower than my Honor 8 did (which has Type-C). But the battery seems to last longer with the same amount of use. There is no reason to spend $900 on an iPhone X or a Galaxy S9 when this phone is a solid workhorse. If this phone were broken, lost, stolen or damaged I wouldn't be crying over the $220 spent on this phone. Good choice for a budget conscious buyer or looking to get a phone for your phone phone-abusive teenager(s).",Postif
"I really enjoy using this phone, and I laugh every day that I didnt have to sign a new contract with my cell phone provider. I had a 6plus that wouldnt hold a charge and kept freezing so it was time for a new phone. Ive had this phone for 3 weeks and I can tell you that I will never pay $1000 for a phone again, nor will I spend the extra $35/ month to lease a phone and then 18 months later not even own it and have to sign a contact once again. These cell phone companies are making record profits not only on the cellular service but on the mark up on smart phones. Buy this phone and be free of indentured servitude. With moderate use, going on Twitter, watching Netflix, and texting throughout the day, this phone holds its charge for 1.5 days. In my opinion this phone does just about everything the $1000 phones do except the sound quality is a little less than par. But really, is that worth being locked into a contract and worth also paying $750 extra? Happy shopping!",Postif
"Had the Mate SE for about a week. First impressions it installed well from scratch though the Android 8 update took overnight. It's fast and screen navigation is excellent. Features like my own ring tones installed flawlessly. One gripe a lot of the native themes and images are not easy to turn off or Uninstaller. It does let the user opt out of the native Huawei apps like subbing Google photos for Gallery. But then when on tries to customize wallpaper and Screensavers from Photos the Huawei Android blocks access. So far that is the only negative. Doesn't feel like a $200 smartphone. The included poly case is very adequate. Screen is big real estate. I like it a lot. Tons of free Ram and lots of extra memory even without an SD. I feel hooked!

Update after 1 month: super fast, very responsive screen, tons of storage. Tends to slip out of my trouser pocket in the car, of course because its so big. Screen super bright, I am running it at 40%; no pixels apparent. The bottom row of buttons that were hardware on old phone are soft and change between apps in this version of Android. Will probably add a thin glass screen cover. The 5 stars are secure...",Postif
"This is my third Huawei phone. The one thing I really appreciate about them over other smartphones is they are simple unlocked smartphones that are not loaded with bloat. Likewise moving my information from my old honor to this new phone was extremely quick.
The display is crisp, the camera works well, and apps perform as they should.
Now there is one new thing I noticed on the phone, and that is the camera app has a great deal more these days.
Now mind you...feature bloat has become a thing and higher priced phones usually take more battery life and are more fragile.
Either way, I am not likely to move off of Huawei if they keep offering decent unlocked phones at an affordable price. It is hard to find a phone this good with these specs at this price level.",Postif
"I bought this phone based on a coworker's recommendation. I'd owned by ZTE Pro Max for a few years and was desperately in need of an upgrade. I received the phone, switched it over to Metro PCS with no issues, and it's quite quick and responsive. Apps act as they should, and overall it feels good in my hands.

So why the two star review? Having only owned it less than two weeks, I've already encountered a couple of major problems.

PROs

Very responsive in terms of speed
Updated to Android Oreo (8.0) with no issues
Easy to configure

CONs

Sound Quality - I'm hard of hearing and it's significantly quieter than other phones I've used, even on max sound settings.
Screen Quality - I'm a klutz, so I put every phone of mine into hard cases with screen protectors. I owned my ZTE for 3ish years and I've dropped it more than once with minor scratches to show for it. I dropped this once from my nightstand (about 2-2 1/2 feet high) and I have significant cracks along the front of the phone. In the end, it's my fault that it dropped, but the fact that it could be cracked by such a small distance (even through its case) serves as fair warning to anyone that might be considering this phone and deals with the same issue.

I'm going to keep the phone and eventually replace the screen with something better. I just wish I didn't have to right out of the box.",Negatif
"This device is awesome! I've had it for a few weeks now and am completely satisfied coming from a galaxy s6 active. I paid $700+ for my Galaxy s6 almost 3 years ago and was the best phone I've had until now. The screen is nice and large and pictures are great! The fingerprint scanner is instantaneous. I don't mind microUSB since I've never had type c to miss it. The phone is lagless and snappy.

The battery life is ridiculous. I have had 19 hour days and I have never seen my battery lower than 50%. Incredible

Buy this phone!!!!",Postif
"The reviews speak for themselves. I was pleasantly surprised. It's got to be one of the best mid range budget phones on the market. The gov will tell you otherwise. Personally if the ""you know who"" wants to spy on me, collect my data and what not, it isn't anything that my previous phones haven't done already! This phone is as good if not better than my ageing S7 edge which cost a hell of a lot more back then. It will take some Android users a while to get used to the UI but it's pretty much the same. No more expensive lock in contracts for me. At the end of the day it's fast as and meets my needs. If it dies on me or takes that death plunge to the floor, It's not going to break the bank. Dual Sims make overseas trips much cheaper, just pick up a cheap prepaid sim card when you get to where your going. So there you go, this phone ticks all the boxes for me. Hope this helps you decide.",Postif
"I have had this pretty awesome phone since April 2018 & over all I am pretty darn happy with it. It has a pretty decent battery and with a proper charger with an output of 5V, it charges pretty fast. Plenty of memory and with an added sd card, I have way more than enough for now even though I'm constantly recording videos. Picture quality is decent and has a lot of edit options. I've been using a few unlocked phones since my Galaxy S5 & and this phone feels top of the line. The fingerprint sensor is awesome. I do wish it had a louder speaker and my GPS sensor seems to be on the slow side. I am not sure if that GPS issue is due to the dozens of drops it received already. I cracked the screen once and had it replaced with an Huawei Honor screen and that one ended up cracking as well, but it is way more resilient and has not deteriorated to where it needs replacing.",Postif
"So far I am very happy with this phone. I am never wasting a ton of money on a phone again! It is reasonably fast and has been very reliable. The display is very good. The battery is very good and so far easily lasts 2 days with general use. I do not play games on my phone but I do text often and perform the basic things like checking my e-mail, banking, phone calls, Facebook, etc. The phone handles these tasks easily. I have only been using it for a week or so but so far I could not be happier. The camera is adequate. I read some reviews knocking the speakers but I don't listen to a lot of music or anything like that on my phone. I have played a few videos off YouTube and I thought the speakers were fine. Phone calls sound good to me. If it starts acting up I will update my review but so far 5 stars all the way.",Postif
"Well, I have had it about a month, but so far, it is amazing. After reading many reviews here on amazon, I was convinced it was a good phone. I am glad I purchased it. My previous phone was the Zenfone 2 Laser, I definitely feel like this is an upgrade. I am not a gamer, so I havent tried any games, but as far as videos, browsing, and other apps, everything is top notch. Very responsive UI, no lag. Phone came with Android 7, but I checked for updates right away and it updated to Android 8 and the latest version of EMUI.

This is my first Huawei phone, but I have a feeling it won't be my last. At this price point, this phone performs as well as the more expensive ones.

Was concerned a little about volume since there is only 1 speaker, but it does just fine. Call quality seems great, havent had any complaints.
Screen is bright and colors are vivid...I am impressed. Nice job Huawei. Love It.",Postif
"Having owned several iPhones since their launch, I got to the point where every next generation was more disappointing. I decided to save $800 and try the Huawei, a brand I was familiar with in Europe where they've had a presence for many years. Is it as good as an iPhone? Probably not. Is it an excellent phone? Absolutely. I've had it now about 3 weeks, have gotten used to android, and couldn't be happier. If I only keep it a year I'm good. If it drops and breaks it's cheap to replace. It does everything I need it to do. The speakers are not great, but adequate. The photos are not excellent, but good. Screen is great. Finger print work well. Functions are as they should be. I paid $225 odd for this, and that's a bargain. Good battery life, quick charging, and I just bought a memory card to boost this thing... You won't go wrong, unless fashions, brands, and bragging rights are your weakness.",Postif
"2nd Edit: After receiving replacement phone - 4 STAR REVIEW

Amazon quickly sent my replacement, and I'm in love! The speaker phone still sounds fuzzy, people tell me. But me, I'm thrilled. (The workaround is to use WhatsApp, speaker becomes awesome!) Additionally, the notifications ping & flash accurately on this phone, so I can tell what's a text & what's the phone. Anyhow - overall, best phone I've ever used. I'll update again if it falls apart but so far, I'm LOVIN' IT. I had to dock it 1 star for the sketchy speaker phone but heck. It's still good.

Edit: One week later - 3 STAR REVIEW

Soooo sad - I've started having the phone jack & speaker phone issues others mentioned. Headphones didn't work while plugging in on a work-related call. And I cut out & people couldn't hear me when using the speaker phone. I'm gonna return & try to replace with a new one & will update again. I SO love this phone.

At purchase: 5 STAR REVIEW

Just purchased...but looks like, this is why the US is trying to keep Huawei out of the country - they'd put Apple out of business. And def Samsung, with its slow-loading speeds on devices (at least the older ones).

I'll update my review later, in case the phone dies or whatever or I find new things to like. I haven't played with a lot of the functionality, mostly used in normal operations, but here's what I can tell now:

Pros:

- It's the fastest device I've ever touched. Loads faster than I can blink almost, unbelievable. This alone is a reason to purchase, I'd say. I measured it side-by-side with a Nokia 6, to gauge loading times & in most cases, this phone was speedier. Sometimes notably so.
- Fingerprint scanner/phone unlock in the back works 100% of the time and it's amazing not to have to use a password anymore.
- Ability to easily split screen & have two apps open is really cool.
- Camera is amazing, both selfie & regular views. Fast shutter speed. Allows macro photography. Captures photo ok in different lighting (though I haven't taken a lot of photos against windows yet).

Cons:

- No normal text notifications. The LED is very small & hard to see, so that doesn't really work. I read up on how to set tonal notifications, but now my phone rings like a call when I have an e-mail. Somehow I got texts notifications to ping, by playing with the settings. I'll still have to research how to get this set up right. It's def weird.
- The speakerphone isn't as good as the Nokia 6, for example, when I play music. Lacks bass. I'll keep playing with equalizer apps & see if this improves.
- Speakerphone during regular calls (to Canada) is more muffled than when I use Whatsapp! Not sure why this is.",Postif
"I am glad I bought this phone. It is a great value for $219.00 plus tax. I do not experience any connectivity issues with bluetooth or any other device. It's fast and reliable. Fingerprint reader is extremely fast. The volume can be turned up quite loud. The camera is pretty darn good too. I really have no complaints and I'm pretty picky about this type of stuff. I'm done with expensive smart phones and hope this lasts a while.
If you're looking for a great value I recommend this HUAWEI.",Postif
"I've had the phone for about 6 months now, after my friend recommended it to me as an upgrade to my S6. The phone material feels high quality and it has a decent weight to it. Since it's a bit longer than average phones, it does kind of sit awkward in the hand, and sometimes it can be rather difficult to reach all of the screen while using it with one hand (I'll just blame me having small hands.) My phone had some weird bubbling under the screen, but it hasn't impacted usability, and if I chose to, I could send the phone back to have it repaired as it is a manufactures defect (I haven't though, due to pure laziness and the fact that it's pretty easy to tune out.) Apps run snappy, but some may have display issues due to the longer screen. I personally haven't come into any who have had the issue, but I get the prompt every time I expand an app to full screen that there may be some issues. The back camera is good, I can say that it is better than the S6 but can't say the same for the front camera. I can't tell if its the OS and the UI that limits the function of the front camera (like being able to focus on a face while taking a selfie) or if the front camera is just bad. Either way, I can't really be upset. The true winner of this phone is the battery life. You can go all day with moderate to heavy use and by the time you go to plug it in at night, there will still be half a battery left. It's a good phone for a tight budget, but let its low price convince you that it's low quality.",Postif
"I had been waiting to get a new smartphone for a few years. The smartphone I used prior to the Huawei mate se was the iPhone 5, which I started using in 2013. It was fine for a few years until the iOS updates started slowly down my phone and shortening the battery life. A few years ago the iPhone 5 was no longer supported, and I was left with a phone that was not too useful anymore. Somethings I liked about the iPhone 5 was the camera, the iMessage, and the form of the phone. What I disliked was the amount of memory, amount of storage space, general slowness of the phone, the apple apps filled with ads, the touch detection accuracy, and the low battery life. Since I have switched to the Huawei mate se, my iPhone is being used as a iPod touch which has to be recharged every 2 days to be used, even if it is turned off.

What I disliked about my iPhone 5, I looked for in the recent smartphones. The Huawei mate se was the cheapest smartphone I could find that was the best fit for what I was looking for. It has 4 GB RAM, 64 GB storage space which can be expanded with micro SD card, a faster processor, a bigger screen, and a long battery life. Compared to my iPhone 5 which required recharges every 2 days, I only have to recharge my mate se once every 5 or so days. The camera is somewhat comparable to the iPhone, but does not seem as clear regardless of the mode. However it looks like it has more customizations when using the camera. Since this is an Android phone, it is lot more customizable that the iPhone. It runs on EMUI which is Huawei's Android variation, and it updated usually every month with security patches. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone is very handy for unlocking the phone. This phone has been an improvement to my life since I have switched smartphones. The only issue I have been having with my phone is with messaging. There are occasional instances where my group messages are sent and lost, but there is no indication that these messages disappeared into thin air. The only way I have been able to solve this is to get to area where the mobile data reception is 4 bars or greater before sending the text.

The phone comes in a white box inside a cardboard box. It comes with a plastic phone case that can be used unless you want to switch to a decent phone case. There are no screen protectors, and the SIM card slot pin is provided. Getting the phone setup was easy, and it was easy for me to switch from using iOS to EMUI.

This is one of the best cheap smartphones out there right now. If you don't want to spend $800+ to get a fancy iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, this phone may be for you.",Postif
"Best customer service: GPS stop working after a month. Huawei was easy to reach, got me a shipping label, repaired the phone and sent it back to me within 10 days.
Works perfectly. Great phone and it seems that my issue was isolated.
Can beat the value plus a great customer service",Postif
Bluetooth and Wifi issues . I really like this phone for the fact that it is very affordable and offers a same level of high end smartphone options. problems that I am having with this phone is the Bluetooth and wifi connection. I have never had this issue before even though Bluetooth connects to my car but it doesn't feed phone connection. I have to reboot the phone in order to get it work. Other than that great device. Picture quality is better than most of the low budget phones. It does not have NFC which is a must for me since I use Google pay often. Wifi connection has intermittent issues that gets extremely slow for no reason. I thought it was the router but the other devices side by side has no issues. Huawei is a budget phone and it gives you exactly what you pay for. BEWARE.,Negatif
"Best ""bang for your buck"" smart phone. Ive been an Apple iPhone user forever, with an exception of a short stint of switching over to a Galaxy s3 for a little bit, then going back to the iPhone once they started selling the bigger screens.

Well my iPhone 6 plus finally took a dump after so many years of apple trying to slow it down with their os upgrades and trying to have me upgrade to their newer iPhones. i decided to give this Huawei a try since it's pretty affordable. Well, I haven't been disappointed yet...it does its job well and I'm very happy. My wife is pissed off because it seems I wanna stay with android while my fam is on Apple. Well, how 'but them apples?!? ??",Postif
"First reason to buy this phone, The US government said not to! Seriously this was a huge reason for me as I noticed they were dwarfing samsung in sales and getting closer to toppling I phone from #1. If you looked at the Honor 7x and wanted a extra Gb of ram and 32 more GB of storage this is a must have. It also boasts a large 5.93"" screen with minimal bezel. Oh so sexy for a budget device. It has a solid build and beautiful screen. After having it for over a week I noticed most complaints were unwarranted since some people are spoiled by more robust screens.

Granted this is not a ""flagship level"" phone but for the price it delivers above what any reasonable person would expect. The finger print sensor needed some getting used to. I have never had a phone like this before. It defiantly beet the Galaxy s4, Blu energy x plus, ZTE and other phones I have owned in function and form.

I love the screen most although it is not for small handed people except for the shrink feature allowing one handed use. It even has eye comfort built right in. Love that. The US government has no real proof to there allegations since there has not even been a formal charge filed against Huewai and seriously I doubt this company would jeopardize their profit margin with such foolery.

If you need a honest opinion buy it you will love it, just remember no matter how good the phone apps can still be less than perfect.",Postif
"What an amazing phone I totally love this phone I can't believe the money that people spend on Samsungs and iPhones that's ridiculous. This phone is absolutely the bomb for the price if absolutely cannot be beat. I've been a Apple user for the past decade and I think I'm now going to change. This Huawei rocks and I'm looking forward to getting there Mate 10 laptop. The fingerprint recognition is super fast. This camera also takes amazing pictures and it's response time is really quick I don't have to wait for anything to open up boom it's there. The biggest downside for me is that you can't hook it up to a TV via HDMI adapter. You have to have a smart TV and you can mirror it Bluetooth Style. I guess I'm going to have to get a smart TV because I'm sure not going to get rid of this phone. This is my second Huawei phone due to my negligence I had to buy another one. The first Huawei phone, I jumped into the ocean took it out let it dry overnight and it came back on and worked perfectly I don't know how but it did. The second time I left it out in the rain and it was never quite the same after that. The phone turned on but it never ran properly. I'm still impressed because I never expected it to work after I jump in the ocean. Great phone well-built durable it's a rockstar.",Postif
"I absolutely love this phone. I have an issue with the screen not turning on shortly after receiving it, however Amazon swiftly sent me a replacement. This phones user interface is fantastic. I am die-hard android, so that may make me biased. My previous HTC Uplay was a great phone, but the camera quality is unbelievable. I would warn others to avoid sticking this phone in your back pocket, as I did notice mild bowing of the phone. I was skeptical of buying a ""non brand"" phone, but I'm so glad I did.",Postif
"This is my second phone by this company, and,for a lower- priced, smartphone, I honestly cannot complain. My first one, the Honor 6x was getting a bit glitchy after owning it for about a year and a half, but I also rely 100% on my cell phone for everything, and that one was one of the first models I believe that was sold. They do have excellent customer service, available at the touch of a button 24/7.... actually speak directly to a helpful person right away. The camera isn't bad at all,and has improved greatly since the 6x, but is not going to be the quality of a high priced Samsung or iPhone. I've had this now about a month, and will update again at 6 months to see how it's going.",Postif
"I was hesitant at first, being that I had never heard of Huawei, but with the ratings and reviews I decided to replace my S7 with this and I will tell you that I am extremely glad I took that chance. The battery lasts well over a day of constant use and, even better, is SUPER fast to charge. I was expecting this phone to have problems overheating (like certain competitors), i was wrong...watch hours and hours of video and not even have to worry about it getting hot or even warm. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a new phone. 64GB (expandable to 256), unlocked AND at the price it is at, I promise you that the ratings speak for themselves.",Postif
"I bought this phone on May. I was very confortable with the choice because except for the camera wich is no good at all ( i was not excpecting something great for the price) , it was running fast and battery would last for a whole day and even to next morning.
Well, the battery suddenly started to perform really bad and it doesn't last for more than 10 hours with regular used.
As for the signal problemas i got to say it's true. I don't Know why but when i leave a place where i've been using wifi ,phone usually has some issues to get 4g data.
So, it's a good phone for the price but it has some issues that i find really unconfortable.",Negatif
"I upgraded from an old Samsung galaxy 3 that I had been using for about 5 years. It was a huge jump, and the best choice over the Samsung phone I was looking at. I got a decently fast phone, android 7os (hopefully 8), and it came with all sorts of features. The camera was not bad.",Postif
"Huawei is a great phone.
I really admire the phone.
However, there are two unsatisfactory things noted on Huawei Mate: the camera is not as great as I expected. The battery discharges so fast unlike typical Huawei batteries even though there is an additional support option on ultra battery save on battery icon.
Unfortunately, these 2 are the priorities in my decision of choosing a smart phone.",Postif
"This phone has some good reviews online. Unfortunately my experience with it wasn't that good. I have had consistent issues with the Bluetooth radio. This phone consistently looses the connection to my Sony headset, it won't stay connected to my JBL speaker, and it absolutely hates my Fitbit. Additionally it buffers when I'm watching YouTube constantly. I've gone to watching videos at 144p and it still stops every minute or two. This happens whether I'm on 4G or Wi-Fi. After three weeks the menu started flickering whenever I pull it up. Icons would jump from one spot to the next as though they didn't know which order they were supposed to be in. Most recently the phone decided to just restart itself while I was typing a message on Facebook. I've had to restart it at least once a day for the past week so with the auto restarts I'm sending this back. My two year old Blu R1 is more reliable at this time.",Negatif
"Thank god for Capitalism! I needed a new phone and the flagship fruit phone was 800.00, 1000.00 for the one i wanted. But this phone is just as nice. Switching to droid will take some time but I think anyone would switch for 800.00 saved. Put in my t mobile sim and it worked no problem. Finger print thing is really cool. Now the test of time but so far super happy and Amazon dont play when it comes to delivery in the Denver metro area

6 weeks later I have been using this phone all day at work and it has been flawless. I am a service tech and I run different apps all day long, navigation, music, phone calls, texting, and camera my Huawei has been rock solid. Great phone gonna get my boy one!!",Postif
"I know, it's not the name brands we all ""want"". But I can't afford those name brands. And, really, who needs so many bells and whistles?

This phone does plenty of what those phones do and at half the price. I've had a Huawei in the past and liked it well enough that when I was forced to replace a dying phone, I went with this brand because I had such good luck with it.

This one is a good size. If you have eyes that don't see so well, you may have to download a text enhancer for bigger text. The messages are not color coded and the text size is limited. Easily fixed with apps, but that's one of those bells/whistles I do miss; customization.

There are some apps on it I didn't expect and found very helpful. I'm really not missing too much that I know of. :)

Good value. Works well; better than a Samsung I once had...just sayin'. A good mid-level phone.",Postif
"I did a lot of searching before I decided on an upgrade to my Moto X Pure. I was thinking about the moto G4 and Honor 7x but ultimately picked the Mate Se which is an upgraded Honor 7x.

Shipping from Amazon was fast and hassle free. No surprises there.

The actual phone is great. It came with a clear case which was unexpected. I had already purchased a case. The biggest pro about this phone is the battery life which is crazy. I can go days without charging it. The phone is lightning fast and responsive. No waiting or slow transistions. The fingerprint scan on the backside of the phone is great. It works flawlessly and recognizes my fingerprint instantly.

I normally root my phones for performance reasons but decided not to root this phone. Sometimes it's more of a hassle than what it's worth. I like stock Android ROMs. EMUI is not a ""heavy"" interface like Samsung phones. I use Nova Launcher and the phone is as, good as stock android. There are a lot of apps out there now that allow you to block ads so this phone runs great without root.

Transferring apps and messages was a breeze using Huawei's transferring app.

Only thing to remember is there's no NFC and no 5 ghz capability for WiFi. It's a non issue to me.

Only con in my opinion is the speaker. The Moto X Pure had two speakers so you got a louder, more stereo sound. the one speaker on the Mate SE is some what loud but very tingy. Overall, I love the phone. Great purchase.",Postif
"This phone does not look or feel like a $230 phone, it looks and feels more like an iPhone with it's space grey backing. The performance is pretty solid and the Hauwei launcher is not too bad either as it has some useful features. I'm pretty impressed with this phone especially at it's price point when you factor a dual sim card setup and the audio DAC sounds really good with headphones. So far the fingerprint reader has worked reliably to unlock the phone.",Postif
"I am giving this phone a one star because although I like the phone, this is my second one. Amazon send me a replacement phone but I'm still having the same problem and it's really rediculous. I don't have no mobile data on the phone. No, it's not my SIM card either. I've tried putting my SIM card in another phone in it works just fine. This phone makes you update the phone when you first get it. After doing so, all of a sudden the mobile data doesn't work anymore. Mind you I'm still paying for data. I'm so disappointed you have no idea. Has anyone else had this problem?",Negatif
"I was in need of an upgrade from an LG. Four years ago I decided that the monthly contract with either AT&T and Verizon were jut not worth it. I have been with Straight Talk ever since. I purchased this phone, brand new, works on Straight Talk AT&T SIM. I was able to activate this phone very easily. The phone itself is excellent. Has all of the options of my daughter's S9 and I LOVE that the screen is not curved on the edges like the S9. I had no problems at all with this phone. The phone has had several software updates and I have not had problems since the update. I waited several months before getting this phone, it was worth the wait. I have no complaints. Although there still is a lot I need to learn about it still. As of today, I have had the phone for 2 months.",Postif
"Excellent budget phone. Practically fulfilling the needs on latest aps, camera, battery, performance, storage, ram etc. Nothing more to expect for $200. Thanks Amazon for bringing this product as many other shops don't sell Huawei phones.",Postif
Everything about this phone is great. Iput it on par with Samsung 8 and iPhone 8. My last phone was iPhone 6 but due to Apple programing I was very unhappy with it. I got this phone because I perfer Android over iso and was surprised at the quality.,Postif
"I love this phone twenty times more than I expected to. I would actually go so far as to say that it's the best phone I've ever owned. The build quality is impressive and it feels very solid. The pictures it takes are incredible for what it is; I frequently have people ask me what camera I took my pictures with and they are always surprised when I tell them my phone. The display is bright, clear, and crisp. There is absolutely nothing I don't love about it; would purchase again in a heartbeat! You could pay three times the cost and still not have a better phone in my opinion. Buy it, you won't regret it!",Postif
"I got this phone at $249.99 before tax bummer should of wait ???? lol but I'm glad I did purchase phone so far great phone I had a previously purchased the mate 2 yrs ago and I had a very good experience with phone battery?? was awesome????? I decided it was time to upgrade I was surfing tho see which one to get I was between galaxy brand but I was thinking I'm not going to expend a crazy money for a phone so I decided to get another Huawei phone?? and I'm more then happy with my phone. Great size, ??, ??application, emojis. ?? is wonderful last all day with out charging???.i will recommend ????",Postif
"Nice specs, phone was easy to set up and seems nice and fast out of the box. The build quality is high, and the phone feels more expensive than it's price. Battery was at around 80% when it arrived, and seems to hold it's charge well compared to my old Samsung. Minor complaints, the screen dims when looking at it more than maybe 15 degrees off center vertically. Horizontal brightness seems better, but not perfect. This is common on cheaper phones and not a huge deal, overall the screen is nice looking and feels good. Good touch response. The speaker sound as well as the sound output through the headphone jack is not as good as other phones I've had, but is more than acceptable for what I'll use it for. We'll see how it holds up, but first impression of this phone is pretty good.",Postif
"The 1st phone had a software glitch. Screen would not stay on. No adjustment possible. Huawei offered to fix it no charge, Amazons superior customer service replaced it, and I sent the other one back. Its a great phone. Good quality, and fast. The sound it good quality, better than most, approaching Iphone quality, (and 1/3 the price), and the pictures look good to me. The apps from Huawei are also useful and good quality. So far, after getting one that works correctly, Im very happy with the phone, Amazons service, and the Huawei Company. I recommend buying this phone through Amazon.",Postif
"If you know the size of an iPhone 6 plus it is the same size and actually looks like one. It has been a great phone. The case it comes with isn't the greatest, but overall for $250... You can't beat this phone. I had an LG G4 prior to this phone. Oh and it constantly updates it's software which makes me super happy. I chose this over the new LG G7 thinQ. Very happy with it",Postif
"I have been buying the newest flagship phones for about 8 years now. I got tired of the high cost of contracts and the high cost of having the newest phone. I wanted to go to prepaid and started looking for good phones that weren't pushing $1000. Pretty quickly Huawei popped up and in particular the Mate SE. I went from the Note 4 to the iPhone 7 plus to this. Wow! This phone is an amazing deal. I have always leaned towards Android and having this phone has definitely reinforced that. I bought a couple of other prepaid phones before this phone.....there is no comparison. The Mate SE is an AMAZING phone at this price. This brand name was a little foreign to me until I started some research on the best phones for the price. Great screen size, great picture, great power, great battery life and very good camera. I will be looking to Huawei and it's sub brand Honor for my next phones. This phone could easily cost 2-3 times what it does and still be a great phone. That alone speaks volumes. I always loved having the newest and greatest phones.....this phone is so close to flagship and the price is 1/4 of a flagship phone. Highly Recommended!",Postif
"Coming from a Nexus 5 which had started to give me problems, this is an amazing upgrade. The smoothest move I've ever had on a smart phone using Huawei's app to bring every thing over from my Nexus. Even configuring my provider (Ting) was amazingly simple (that had always been the hardest part of switching phones for me). The phone is gorgeous, quick, great battery life, no complaints so far. I was expecting some kind of problem but encountered none that couldn't be resolved. Highly recommended!",Postif
"I have used Samsung Galaxy's since the first one. This phone blows away Samsung. It is hands down a better phone. Battery life, user interface, picture quality, speed, no bloatware! This is the first review I have ever written for a phone, probably my second review ever on Amazon in 10 years. Buy this phone if you're looking at the Galaxy's.",Postif
"I've had the phone for two months and purchased it prior to a European tour. The Dual SIM feature was good. I got a Vodafone SIM for $30 in London and I had phone and data in the five countries we visited. I took a camera, but the phone took great pictures and video. Should have left the camera at home. Battery life is long. I'm not a heavy user and, in the evening, after being in and out of my pocket all day, I still have about 85% battery. When traveling and getting directions and taking lots of pics it got down to the 20's and 30's a couple of times. There was a problem with Bluetooth slowing Wifi down to a crawl when I first bought it but it upgraded to Oreo and that problem was resolved. The fingerprint reader works well except for when my hands are wet and I have to wait for them to dry before I can use the phone. I have no regrets.",Postif
"Very happy with this phone. The only con is that the camera isn't super great but at $230 I'm not going to knock a star for that. Otherwise it runs very smooth, no lag with apps, everything is nice and responsive. Battery life so far has been great, I'm easily getting a full day+ with moderate usage.

Be sure to run the system update when you get it so you get the latest android version.",Postif
"I bought another 6"" phone about 2 years ago, but for some reason I just didn't like it. Decided to buy this one; it's just slightly smaller (I mean maybe 1/16"" in each dimension), and it's much lighter than the other. I have small hands to begin with, and arthritis in my hands and shoulders, and didn't realize that was what was putting me off about the first phone; the weight difference irritated me just enough to make it uncomfortable. All that aside, the phone has a stunning 2560px display (as good as Iphone), works beautifully, is quick as a hiccup, and the fingerprint id works on the first shot every time. The cameras do a lovely job. I got the Orzero case which fit beautifully and looks great. For the price, you can't beat this phone!",Postif
After a few days of owning the phone I have to say it is one of the best phones I've ever purchased. The only flaw I've noticed so far is the bluetooth connected issue with wifi. While I am using my bluetooth headset the rate at which it downloads data dramatically decreases. Other than that I am veeerryyy happy with the phone so far. The battery last like 2 days its amazing.,Postif
"I could not tell much difference between this phone and my iPhone7Plus. It is fast, screen/picture quality outstanding, and the best part is that it has dual sim/memory slot. This is super convenient for international travelers. Works perfectly in Asia and Europe. Switching between the sims is seamless. You can also boost the memory big time with your own microSD card.

Cons: the face recognition is a slightly slower than finger print.

This phone is worth every single penny you pay.",Postif
"Bought this for our daughter who broke her iPhone but not eligible for an upgrade and no insurance. Still have to pay on a broken phone, but daughter needed one. She actually likes this one better than her iphone!! Less glitchy, and she's always liked the Android apps better. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and for the price, you can't beat it! Husband and I are seriously considering Huawei phones purchased outright instead of Samsung and monthly payments!",Postif
"I've had this phone for about 5 months now and don't have a single complaint. Like others, I was skeptical at first. I've always had Samsung Galaxy phones and my current one needed upgrading, but didn't want to spend another $900 for a s9 plus.

I came across this one based on something I read on cnet and decided to give it a shot. It's completely lived up to expectations and more. Everything I do on a Samsung phone can be done on this one to the same level. It's fast, never freezes, streams videos with ease, and the sound quality is good. Battery life is great. It lasts forever. Picture quality is fine, but not as good as you'd get from a Samsung or iPhone. I don't take many pictures so I really don't care about having the best quality pictures, but it's more than adequate for me.

In short, if you're on the fence about this phone, don't be. Get it. I'll never high prices for a Samsung again when phones like this are available.",Postif
"This phone is absolutely awesome. I have had a couple of galaxies in the past, the most recent being the S7 Edge, and I had more hang ups and problems with the Galaxies. The phone looks and feels really nice, the screen is beautiful, and the fingerprint scanner is great. The photo quality seems fine to me and the camera app opens very quickly so you don't miss any good shots. I have only two complaints: it has good specs and plenty of memory, but you can't install Fortnite on it, and it has the 18:9 screen ratio, so 16:9 videos have space on either size, but this is just my preference.",Postif
"OMG! I will never spend $1000 on a phone again. My carrier is MetroPCs, which uses T-Mobile bands. I have no issues with LTE or phone signal whatsoever. I did make a mistake when switching SIM cards though. When I received it, I switched SIM card and it didn't work. I thought it was the phone not compatible with my carrier, but it turns out I had to call the Carrier and they will have to reactivate the SIM card using the new phone's unique ID. That took 2 minutes over phone and it was done absolutely free. Ever since then, no issues at all. So please call your carrier to inquire about the SIM card transferring to the new phone. Phone runs super fast and has the exact same internal storage amount (64GB) as my old iphone 6s that has been giving me issues charging for months. Not to mention, I can buy a SD card to extend the storage to $256GB!!! This phone has very long hours of battery and fast operation. Takes decent pictures as well. I can't believe it took me so long to switch! The only thing is that the selfie camera is not as good as my iphone, which is ok with me, since I barely take any selfies anyway.",Postif
"I went to downtown yesterday. My son used my phone playing games online for one hour on the way. Then I used my phone google map as my GPS for one hour. My son played games during lunch time and break time. I took some photos at night. Then it was still 50% power left when we got on the train. My son watched videos for a hour on the train. It was 40% power left when we arrived home. Cool! It is in winter. My previous Samsung phone never had such long standby time. Moreover, charging battery is super fast. I am very happy with it. However, about taking pictures, the phone has an automatic beautification function. Although I turned off the beautification function, but in the pic the human skin is still too smooth, and even my lunch is beautified. This, I don't really like it.",Postif
"Very happy with this Huawei Mate SE purchase! The overall quality is excellent especially for a $200 phone.
The main feature I value is the 4GB of Ram. Apps run well, internet pages load quickly, app update installs are quick, etc. The local storage allows many multiple apps to be installed along with videos, music, etc, Additionally I use Nova Launcher instead of the native one and there is no lag whatsoever.

Other features I like include:
- Being able to access the SD card without opening case
- There is a 3mm headphone jack
- The fingerprint reader is lightening fast
- The screen size is large enough to comfortably watch videos while not making the phone so large so it is unwieldy
- Screen resolution, camera quality, sound quality are all great especially at this price.

This phone exceeded my expectations. Plus it looks sleek especially in the gold color. The Huawei Mate SE has the same external design as the Huawei Honor 7x model which was a wide selling phone. This means that many accessories designed to work with the Honor 7x will also work with the Mate SE.

I've had the Huawei Mate SE for about three months and highly recommend it if you're looking for a $200 - $250 cell phone with excellent quality and great selection of features.",Postif
"I've had this phone for just under 3 months. After only having flagships (iPhone, Samsung & LG), I am very happy with this phone.

The only thing I am unhappy about is no NFC. But for the $224 I paid, I can't really complain. Also, I knew going in the camera was not flagship quality. I don't really use it that often, so I am ok with that. This might be a concern for others.

I find it to be a fast and responsive phone. The battery life is great. The screen is fine. Battery life is excellent. I can leave it unplugged over night at 100% and it's going to be at 98% when I wake up 7 hours later.

I'm with T-Mobile and it works well with their signal. Voice calls have been 100% relaible. It should be noted, I live in a large city

I've had the Huawei mediapad m3 for one year and now the Mate SE. I plan on getting a Huawei flagship for my next phone. I can't say enough about my user experience with Huawei products. I figure I will get a Huawei flagship one iteration behind for $300 and I know I'll be very happy.",Postif
"Great phone for a great price.
-Beautiful, vivid screen, great for viewing videos and games
-Sleek, attractive design, easy to operate with one hand
-Responsive finger print unlock is super convenient and time saving
-Lots of space left even after built-in apps (about 48gb free out of 64gb)
-Screen flash means low light selfies are better than my previous phones
-Front facing camera takes good quality photos
-Battery lasts ALL day with consistent use on WiFi
-Comes with clear, jelly case which does a fair job of protecting the phone without obscuring its beautiful design (wouldn't count on it to protect against drops, however)

One weakness:
-Built in speakers are not great quality: a bit hollow, tinny sounding and not super loud (although usually use my headphones or bluetooth speakers, so this does not bother me)

Would definitely recommend to a friend.",Postif
I ordered this phone because of the price it featured the components I liked . Behold the feel weight and form felt right to me much higher quality than expected . screen viewing is average build is excellent . nothing out of the ordinary just feels like a quality product.i was overcome with a feeling of lucky pride to have this phone in my possession.i set up the accounts this was above the price category it was smooth responsive and fast. Not the fastest I encountered but fast as I could go great pace and fluidity.its been a few days since I have first ran it.no flaw's of any kind.it had I believe in house computer processers . excuse my lingo. I like company's that stand by there crations this brand seemed to houner that stand.verry nice I will have to get some of the other phones and products in the future .I truly appreciate this phone because it is original in it's presentation.it has instructions on the back kudos to the design engineer and company for taking an out of the box idea and creatiand marketing this phone.i love it it is among my most recap need at this price range.love and peace out miles,Postif
"Replaced my nearly 3 year old LG G4 with this phone. Didn't want to pay flagship prices for a phone I am only going to own for another 3 years. Saw the reviews on this phone and decided ""why not?"" Have had this phone for 2 months now and not regretting the decision at all! Am new to the brand and it's very easy to learn (it is Android-based). Removed some of the pre-installed software that came with the phone that I wasn't going to use. I've taken some really good pics with this phone, without having to play around with the advanced settings. The phone is fast while navigating different apps as well! I'm heavy on Facebook, Yahoo Finance, YouTube, Mail, and Google. Sound using the phone speakers could be better. The volume seems a bit low. However, when connected to a headset or Bluetooth device, is quite good. The best part of this phone, you ask? The BATTERY LIFE!! I only need to charge this phone every 2 DAYS! Hopefully the battery life stays like that for a while. So I am pretty happy with this phone. Glad I purchased! :-)",Postif
The phone was really good but had one issue. The touch screen was very laggy. I am not sure if it was only an issue with the one I received because I did not see this in the reviews but the lag was bad enough for me to return it the same day. I would have loved to keep it for the configuration and the features.,Postif
"I owned the honor 7 before this phone and it was really impressive however I had to give it to my brother as he was leaving for school ( he too was and is still impressed). I decided to upgrade to the 64 gb 4 GB ram mate se and I have never regretted it. This phone has the feeland performance of a much more expensive handset ,my only gripe is that the sound is a bit low but the headphone jack makes up for that I would easily buy this phone again and again without hesitation",Postif
"I purchased this to replace my Note 3. I enjoy it a lot. This phone has many options like turning off mobile data but keeping the regular cell services on; which my Note 3 said it did but it didn't work correctly. The pictures are wonderful and it is well designed. It tells me when apps are using a lot of battery which I like to know. Many apps are not made for such a long screen though so it asks every time I open an app to make it full screen or not (not a pop up, just an option at the bottom of the screen) which is obnoxious.",Postif
"I just got the phone for barely over 24 hours but so far I am impressed with it. The only features that I wish it had are 1. dual band WiFi, 2. stereo speaker and 3. NFC. None of these are deal breaker for me and I am very happy with the purchase. I will report back if something go wrong after a few months of use.

An interesting thing is when I received the package, it is obvious to me right away that somewhere along the delivery process someone has opened the box and inspect the contents since the phone is all by itself and not in the original white Huawei box. But the phone is in good shape and didn't seem there is any missing parts or accessories. I guess instead of worrying about the Chinese government is spying on my phone, I now may have to worry about FBI/NSA/CIA may have bugged my phone :)",Postif
"This is an exact replica of iphone in every aspect. I ordered two times of this phone. Each time had some issues right after setup, returned in 2 days.
1st - reading memory card error, stuck in the process of setup and being frozen.
2nd - reading memory card error, after setup, respond abnormally, very weird.
If you wish to keep your privacy and confidential information, do not use this phone. Huawei's devices are very famous at data theft.",Negatif
"I was using a terrible Samsung J7 Perx from Sprint and I was so unhappy with it. I bought this Huawei (Hoo-way-we) and I was able to keep my phone number by going to Walmart and buying the ""Walmart Family Mobile"" plan powered by T-Mobile. I now have unlimited text, talk, and data for $40 bucks! All I did was buy the SIM card activation kit and wait one day for the number to transfer and I was set. Sprint plans do not work with this phone. T-mobile does. I am not sure about other carriers. I love this phone, it is so fast and looks like an iphone and it comes with a clear case! Winning!",Postif
"A beautiful, very capable Android smartphone for $230, a fraction of flagship phones! Looks nice, performs well, and quick. I have not enabled its phone-use capabilities yet, so can't comment on it until I do. I am currently only using it at home with my WiFi network for surfing and entertainment uses. Great purchase.
8/14/18 Update: I've obtained a prepaid cell phone service provider who uses Verizon's network about 3 weeks ago. The phone is working nicely.",Postif
"Had it for over a month now. It's holding up. No problems yet, or at least no significant problems. I use T-Mobile on this phone and it works, however I'm getting delayed text messages. Not sure if it's from TMobile because I contacted them and they said their nearby towers are all working fine and they reset my service or my connection and I'm still getting this problem from time to time. Not 100% blaming it on the phone yet, this is just something I've noticed.",Postif
"Technology is at the point where purchasing a cell phone for $800+ is no longer a necessity if you want a quality device. So many manufacturers are creating devices at budget friendly prices that are quite comparable to the more expensive ones. And, the Huawei device for perfectly into the budget friendly category. Granted, it can't do EVERYTHING the newest device on the market can do, but honestly ask yourself - do you use ALL those features. I, personally, do not, so the Mate SE suits me just fine. It is a great price for such a well made, well functioning phone. I've had it for almost two months now, and I have had no issue whatsoever with it. And, if you care about the version of operating system your phone is running, this phone I'd upgradable to Android 8.0 - Oreo. Seriously recommend this phone if you are budget conscious, and desire good quality.",Postif
"The phone is fast and has a lot of storage. However, the camera sucks. The pictures are grainy and don't have enough clarity. I'm coming from having a Moto x pure for two yrs which has a 21 mp camera with really decent pictures. Also, the phone doesn't have quick charging. Overall, it's not bad for the price but I feel like I'm taking pictures with a 10 yr old flip phone",Postif
"I bought it for my daughter, and she likes it a lot. This phone is fast, it always gets the strongest wifi signal compared with 4 other phones in my home. Some people complaint about the camera, but I think the pictures took by the phone is pretty good. You even can use Facial ID to unlock the phone. For some reason, used the GPS on Google map didn't work at first, after I restarted the phone a couple of times, it works very well now. Thanks Huawei for making such a nice phone at such a reasonable price. I hope the Honor 8x will be here soon.",Postif
"The Huawei Mate SE supposedly has an IP67 rating. IP67 means the unit can be dropped into a body of water up to a meter deep for half an hour. I dropped mine into a 4 inch bowl of water for less than 2 seconds and it was damaged beyond repair. Huawei itself refuses to fix the phone since it was dropped in water and it therefore voids the warranty (odd that the warranty doesn't guarantee their IP67 rating, but that's probably common for phones). I tried to get it fixed at a local repair shop but they tried and failed, claiming that they would have to replace the motherboard and the LCD screen. At that point it would be cheaper to buy another phone.

Had it not broken so easily, I would've given the phone 3.5 stars.",Negatif
"Absolutely stellar phone for the price!
My last five personal phones were all Samsung Galaxies. After almost purchasing the new Samsung Note ($1000),I decided to give this highly reviewed and affordable phone a shot first.
I am extremely happy that I did as I am absolutely astounded that a phone of this capability and capacity is available at this price.
I installed my favorite launcher (Smart Launcher) and I was all set.
Great speed, great pics, ultra fast fingerprint sensor, and all around fantastic piece of equipment.
Definitely recommend this affordable powerhouse of a phone.",Postif
"Its literally an iPhone for a 1/4 the cost. The fingerprint is amazing, three months in the processing is fine, the battery is leagues beyond apple. The sound quality is ok and the volume variability is absolutely abysmal. I use a samsung tablet in my car for spotify instead of my phone. It works ok enough when paired with my powerbeats3 since they can boost the volume too but the loud is too soft and the soft isn't soft enough. Picture quality is good. Literally everything else is good except the sound, but hey saving $600 on an off brand iPhone.",Postif
"After using a LG G3 for years, this was a great upgrade, despite it's consideration as a cheap device. For one, the fingerprint sensor, which is fast, is located on the back, similar to the back located button on the G3. Second, it has more RAM and storage with expandable support for up to 256 GB. Only downside is no removable battery. Speaking of the battery it is large and easily lasts all day. Overall, a snappy device that is a steal at the price I paid.",Postif
"I've been using this phone for around 10 months now and so far I am pretty happy with it. Given the price, this phone is amazing. Fast, fluid and not heavy at all. The only thing I can tell the doesn't work very well is the automatic turn off of the screen when you're calling: sometimes the screen turns on and you realize you've accidentaly opened some of the apps, or turn on/off the wifi/Bluetooth/etc.",Postif
"In general I love the phone. However I began to notice a problem with notification with two apps. One is ebay the second is my ring doorbell app. For one the ringdoor bell app is missing the app ring tone page to customize notification. Spoke to RIng and he mention this is a problem with certain phone, though he did not mention Huawei in particularly. Also missed some Ring notification until I manually brought up the app. My ebay notification for some reason have stopped working. I have adjusted battery optimization and notification setting for ebay app and got it to work once and then stopped again. Still working on the these two problems. I have noticed searching the web that other people have complained about the same problem with Huawei phones in general. If I can get this resolve I will have to buy a different phone.

update 12/17/18
I seem to have gotten the notifications working again. You have the adjust the battery optimization settings on a per app basis. I have set ebay to manual control in the battery optimization. I started receiving notification again.",Postif
"Great ""budget"" smartphone! I've had an LG Stylo 3, ZTE Z Max Pro, LG G3, and iPhone 4, and now this Huawei Mate SE is definitely one of the best smartphones I've had. Runs fast and smooth, looks great, battery life is decent (but could be a little better imo), speaker quality and call quality are sufficient. The screen looks awesome and the interface is very responsive on all apps so far! I was in between this and the Honor 7X and from what I've read so far I'm happy with my decision. I'm using MetroPCS as phone carrier. Really enjoy this phone and I'm looking forward to the update to Android 8 Oreo (EMUI 8)!

UPDATE: I received the update to Android 8 Oreo/EMUI 8!! This is a great phone for a great price! :)",Postif
"I went to Bestbuy to buy this phone after looking at it on their display lineup and they no longer have it in stock. At all. They don't sell it anymore so I bought it from Amazon. Great phone with great specs. It is fast and smooth. The camera is great. Low light can be bad but there is an option to lighten up the photo if you tap on the screen before you take the picture. Nice big screen, thin and only 250 bucks. I will never sign a contract where I pay monthly for a phone and then through the nose for a plan as long as I can find homes like this one. Only downside is it is operating Android 7.0. so sending a gif in a text is not possible. Not a deal breaker but annoying. Waiting for the update.",Postif
"Everything works as intended on this phone, camera stabilization isn't what I was used to, however given the price point and coming from a flagship this was more than acceptable since I don't take many pictures. battery lasts me a good 3 days of normal use, 4 if skip out playing games on my lunch break. Got it used with a minor scratch on the rear. You will need a case of some kind as the phone feels slick with dry hands, which thankfully it came with a clear rubber one. update pushes have been steady and feels like they push more updates than my old phone which I'm grateful for, makes me feel like the product will continue to be supported rather than left and forgotten after a year. The finger print reader is hella fast and 90%+ it gets it the first time even with sloppy pressing.",Postif
"This phone is overall amazing for it's price! As everyone said in the reviews section, the pros of this phone are quite exemplary. Amazing interface the phone is lightweight, and everything is just good. Understand that the good comes with the bad and this phone has some bad features such as sometimes poor camera quality.

I really don't know much about phones. I've been an Apple user and this was such a different kind of place, but a good kind of place you know? I'm really surprised with this phone though. I've abused it so much (dropped it, installed some extensive things, sat on it, used it for 20 hours no break) but this phone didn't seem to become worn. Everytime the phone faces adversity, it kept plowing through and just kept working. Even though there were some times that it had froze or shut done unexpectedly, I believe it was my fault for overdoing it a little bit too much.

So yeah! I love this phone and wouldn't want to part with it! It has everything I need and want and that's good!",Postif
"Overall I really like this phone. Haven't had any issues with it, has lots of storage space, fast, fingerprint works. By far my best phone yet. Thinking about upgrading to an iPhone but honestly this phone is close to just as good so it's hard to think about switching when this works fine. Only gripe is the text messaging wouldn't send pictures, I had to install another texting app and that sends them as a group message to the sender and sends my text back to me as well which is annoying but that's more of a software issues. Want to root it but it seems tricky to unlock it. Has a little bit of bloatware but nothing much. Overall a great deal for the money. Any other brand Android would cost about twice as much for a phone this good.",Postif
"I went from an LG V10 to this Huawei Mate SE. My LG V10 failed on me twice. This Huawei phone is already miles ahead of my LG product. If you want an excellent phone at a great price, look no further. This thing puts phones at three times the price to shame. Good job on this one Huawei. I'm not brand loyal by any means. I've had Sony, Samsung, HTC, LG and other smartphones, but if Huawei keeps this kind of quality product and prices, they've just made a customer for life.",Postif
"If you're tech savy enough you can pretty much have the best of ios and the best of android on this phone with ease. Since hauwei did the first pixel. You know, the pixel that actually worked properly. I'm not surprised at all at what a wonderful job they've done with this phone. Ill be a customer for life if they can keep this up. Even replacing it once a year at this price beats buying 1 flagship. You can break it 4 times and replace it. You can also have the same experience during that time frame but for much cheaperIt might not be ip rated or having wireless charging or a fast charging butttttttt. It's got everything else. It's brilliant.",Postif
"I got the phone a year ago to use on the road, and while I was happy with it for a while, the honeymoon ended and I was stick with a phone that failed some major requirements. The Huawei implantation of Bluetooth headsets made it impossible to use the Google Assistant - it refused to open the mike, and the built in mike couldn't pick up voice over road noise. The WiFi receiver got worse over time, to the point where I had to reboot if I wanted WiFi to function. That's a problem when you live on the road, connecting to several truck stops and motels a day. Dual SIM was useless, since the second SIM only supports 2G, which is no longer available for some carriers. The camera is subpar, and the speakerphone is unusable even in a quiet room. I finally bought a Moto 6, and relegated this phone to my backup line. That will allow me to benefit from its one outstanding feature, its long life battery.",Postif
"The screen is great, good viewing angles, and despite not being in the 'right' aspect ratio for watching 16:9 videos it has above average clarity. Battery lasts for more than a day on a single charge, which is really important for me as I travel long distances and can't afford much downtime.
Camera is alright, quality is definitely in the ballpark of other dual-camera configs. Front camera is meh, good enough for Snapchat but don't expect much.
Finger print sensor is snappy and quick.
WLAN connectivity is eh. You don't get AC wifi on this so you won't be able to utilize the full potential of your wifi if it's faster than 30mbps. Doesn't matter because I don't need that much bandwidth.
The only complaint I have is that EMUI is complete garbage. Installed a third party launcher within 5 minutes of using it. Largest complaint is that it doesn't show the number of notifications I have on the icons, instead it just shows a single red dot and expect me to click on it and check it myself. Comes with minimal amount of bloatware that can be manually removed.
Rubbish speakers, but I don't go anywhere without my bluetooth stereo so they don't matter to me.

For the budget you are actually getting a very good deal. Yeah some compromises here and there but $200 is $200.",Postif
"Love the phone! Specially once updated to Android Oreo it's definitely the best phone in this price range and above period! Can do stuff even my friends with iPhones are jeleous! Camera is good, fuzzy in low light though but definitely good in normal/well lit places. The quality of this phone is amazing I paired it off with some all metal gray ziomi headphones and couldn't he happier! The grey metallic shine definitely makes it feel like it's a good quality build, also like the fact that it came with a clear gel case. Face and fingerprint recognition is super fast. Works with Cricket and has plenty of options. I know the huwai OS/UI can be a hit or miss but I enjoy it simple but can be customized to suit your likings like androids. 64gb and the ability to upgrade to 256gb down the road is a huge plus! Love the fact that I can videos in small screen formal while using the internet or another app, super useful!",Postif
"Endless wifi problems. Wont detect the local hotspot that me other devices essily see and connect to; at my gym, constantly loses connection. Same witth signal at cafe; no connection, even after factory reset.",Negatif
"The device is a premium built device. Display quality is also very good. However, the sound quality is poor. At it's loudest the speaker sounds muffle and distorted.

My only other gripe is that when I am downloading files (personal privately owned) and try to play a video simultaneously the video freezes. This never happened with my P9 lite which only had 2GB memory.",Postif
"Seriously, this is the best cell phone I've had. My last phone was an LGG4 and this phone is light years better. I don't read much into the whole US government vs Huawei bs. if you are looking for a premium phone at a budget price, this is the phone to buy.",Postif
"I was sceptical to buy a phone off of Amazon. I mean I had bought phones off Craigslist and FB but for some reason I was still hesitant. That being said this is the coolest phone. The battery lasts for days with moderate use, like during the work day where im maybe not doing as much browising I only charge it every 3 days. Three days! Without having to charge my phone!! Sorry but having converted from the iPhone that was insane to me. Oh and the phone was brand new in the box everything worked out fine. I popped my SD card from my iPhone into the Huawei and it worked immediately.",Postif
"I have been very impressed by this phone, I have been using it for the past 3 months and have only good things to say about it. People also are very impressed by the design some believing its an iPhone. It clearly has an iPhone design its very sleek and light, the fingerprint sensor is super fast. You cant go wrong with this phone.",Postif
"This phone is simply awesome, if you overlook the charging type, it is the best phone out there for the price. The colors are gorgeous, I love the size, and as an audiophile, the output of sound when connected to my car speakers is super clear and has loud bass. I really am proud that I trusted the reviews on here, before this phone I owned a ZTE Axon 7 Mini and I was in love with it, until it broke from one simple fall. I was worried that this phone wouldn't meet my expectations when it came to sound output etc but oh boy IT DOES. Apart from that make sure to get a good cover for this phone.",Postif
It was great... Until it started to restart by itself multiple times a day. It won't update claiming theres an error. Also apps started crashing. The specs and everything on it just great but it's unusable if it does those things which is why I'm giving it a 1 star,Negatif
"- Battery with amazing life lasts for entire day and even more, I spend all the day using mobile data for my social media work, at the end of the day is still 40%

- Software is good, and will get even better with the new OREO update that huawei confirmed will come soon

- Fast and smooth no bugs or lags, even amazing for games and never heat

- Camera is good, not as good as the 1100$ iphone or 800$ samsung note8, but comparing the proce difference, it is good

- Now some might say that its not good cz there is no NFC, or fast charging, or low volume level;
I say that i don't care, I never use the NFC tech, and the battery is more than good it lasts the entire day, no need for fast charging during the day, and the volume is acceptable

so if you want a mobile that is fast, up to date, great battery with an amazing price 229$, this is the one
but if you are looking for a mobile only for the top camera and loud volume speakers, this is not your choice",Postif
"It has great memory, I love the fingerprint capability, and the size is pretty nice. However, picture quality is terrible! Please just save your money if good pictures and video matter to you.",Negatif
"Very good phone at a reasonable price. Many people ask me if it is an iphone. I teach school as a subtitute and go to a lot of different schools. The High School and Middle School students tell me it has a lot of nice features and the comment is almost always, ""I thought it was an Ipnone."" Functionality is excellent. I haven't owned a lot of nice phones so this is by far the best I have had. Only issue I have is it takes a little longer to charge than I was expecting. My husband has the same phone and does not have this issue with his.",Postif
"Galaxy S series is overrated. This machine does all you need at a fraction cost. If there was a 7 of 5 rating I would. Am able to minimize youtube, gps etc while still using other applications. Forget about split screen. This phone gives you a floating youtube or gps screens etc that you can move anywhere on the screen so you can easily multitask.",Postif
"The product is good. and works great. The price is good. The only glaring problem i have is that the phone is not fully encrypted like the majority of other phones. As good as this phone is, and it is good... if i would have known this before buying, i would not have gotten this phone. I value my privacy.",Negatif
"I've now had this phone for over a month, so I feel like I can give some feedback and judge the phone objectively. Note that for work I have an iPhone 8, and went to this Mate SE from a Blu Life X2 after it took a tumble.

Phone as a whole:
It's nicely built and looks sleek and modern, as expected from Huawei. The back finger print scanner works extremely well. The size is good for my hands and I can reach all of the screen with my thumb one handed. All apps run smoothly and I haven't had any issues yet. The speaker phone is nice and loud, not too tin can sounding.

Screen:
Bright colors, compared to the iPhone 8, the colors are very comparable. No issues with videos at all.

Battery:
I play Pokemon Go, and I have hosted 2 other devices (kids) with this phone for 4 hours straight and went from 100% to 25%... the kids phones were dying. Brother in law's Samsung Galaxy new version was also in the red. So... pretty nice. For standard usage, this phone lasts all day. Very impressed.

Camera:
Clearly it's not an iPhone, but the pictures are more or less comparable to the iPhone 8. It's not 100% there, but it's crisp enough to print out pictures with Santa.

In all, the wife likes it so I'm buying one for her too. I'd give it 9/10 stars as it's clearly not a flagship phone, but who cares, it's $250.",Postif
"This cellphone is not much different than any other cellphone I've owned. Is OK nothing out of the ordinary. I bought it after reading many reviews, but I'm not impressed by its performance. Is just a cellphone people. I have nothing negative to write about this phone. So, feel free to buy it, you won't be disappointed. I'm not . ?",Negatif
If you want a great phone with amazing battery life at a $250 price tag than this is it. I've been a Google Nexus phone user for years. But I couldn't pull myself to spend $800-$900 on a Pixel. Plus insurance and if something happened to the phone. It's a huge headache. Long story short I got a cheaper phone and I love it. The battery on this thing is incredible! I could go 2 days with normal use easily. It's a quick and very responsive phone. Anyway if you want a great phone at a great price you found it!!,Postif
"I had to relearn android with this new phone from an iPhone. Fast processor, cool fearures, fairly serviceable phone.

However I just discovered an issue that may be a deal breaker. Just got off the phone with Huawei support and they said there is no fix to my problem.
While on a phone call, every time I click on something the person on the other end can hear All the clicks. If you jump into say Facebook they can hear the videos you are playing, Yikes!

Huawei support just gave me the impression that that is "" normal"" and there is no fix for it.

I will check to see if there is an Android fix for this to be certain and update this review if I find a fix. If not sending phone back.",Negatif
"I am giving my opinion and fact on this product. Many people tend to buy this product mainly for dual sim feature. Unfortunately this mobile will not suit this requirement for the following facts.

When I purchased this product, I went through many reviews in Amazon and based on some satisfaction I went ahead and ordered but got to know after receiving that the second slot which can be used for either second SIM or for memory card supports only 2g. So I am in United States and in this country mobile providers have discontinued 2g long back, very very limited tower gives you 2g signal. My second number which is from India is 4g sim, it did not work as expected in this mobile due to the second slot supporting only 2g. I did not get signal for second slot and I got signal only once for few minutes.

So in my opinion, this mobile is not fit for dual sim facility in ???? United States. This mobile might work good in other country where 2g signal are available.

Since I haven't used the mobile much, I am not giving my feedback on mobile other features like camera, etc.

Hope this helps for customers who are looking this mobile for dual sim facilities.",Postif
"Wow I am impressed. I have an iPhone 7 which is great no complaints but got bored of it. I wanted something different and I happened to see the Huawei phone and the price was reasonable.

Im disappointed with the phone selection in the US. After looking online at phones across the pond , I realized there are more devices available that we never hear of in the US. Anyway, I gambled and received it today. I've been messing with it for a few hours and am impressed with the response no lag time.

Fortuantely, I already have AT&T and slipped in the Sim from my iPhone 7, no problems with the LTE and it connected to my router with no problems either. I'm just glad that I didn't have to spend $700+ for a another phone. I'll be putting my iPhone on eBay!",Postif
"Nice phone. It's a steal at around $200. 4gb of ram, 5.9"" screen and a lot of customization to this phone. Loaded up all my apps from my old phone, no performance hit at all. That 4gb of ram is really showing on this phone. My available memory stay above 2gb. The battery life on this phone has been solid for me. If the phone is optimize it will slowly trickle. But we will see how that last.",Postif
"This phone is a great value for money. It has proven to very stable, smooth to operate and has great battery time. The camera is reasonable for the price and every other feature I need in a phone meets or exceeds my expectation. The phone feels and functions like a premium phone.",Postif
Way too many apps open unintentionally. If I wore a sports jacket where I could keep the phone inside the breast pocket it may work-or a woman carrying a purse with a designated isolated pocket inside the purse for the phone yes maybe. With the push switches extruded from the side of phone one is asking for trouble. I do not like wearing blue jeans but have found they are the easiest and safest for roaming the world. The only way around this is to turn off phone. Then you have to turn it on before using. The size of phone is too long for an isolated front shirt pocket to button up. Even then you may get assaulted and loose phone anyway. Many times I find my front jean pocket is getting warm. Maybe 5 apps have opened up and could be calling someone unintentionally at the same time and battery will be very warm. You have to keep all pressure from these push witches. Also when I misplace my phone it will not ring using skype. Use to find my old phone maybe once or twice a month using this method. Believe I have found a method to remotely access my voice mail. Use to be a snap before. On the question forum I asked this question using a different profile name. I sure do like the feel of the phone and the rear camera. Hopefully someone will debug my skype problem on the question forum,Negatif
"It is pretty fast for the price, and seems to get really good signal for cel, wifi and bluetooth. It isn't a flagship, but honestly I haven't noticed any slowness. I like that it has 4gb of RAM and 64gb flash.

The only issues I've had so far is the tactile stops working in whatsapp (but seems to work elsewhere, so this could be a whatsapp problem - still investigating). That, and I can't figure out how to do a screenshot on it. The power-up-arrow combination starts something that records the screen (video), rather than a screenshot. I just need to look up how.

So far it makes good phone calls, etc.",Postif
Phone was very fast. Worked for one month and shut off and wont restart. Warranty work denied.,Negatif
"I will update this review in a few weeks if necessary but so far I am absolutely happy with this phone. I had to get a new sim card bc my previous phone carried a different size. I went to my current carrier MetroPCS and dropped $15 for the card and they tested that the phone worked which all took about 5-7 minutes.

The phone takes great low light pictures. I understand that the latest model is amazing but this was what my budget could afford now. Google Playstore is accessible and I haven't had any issues with any of my previous used apps.

I crossed my fingers on this purchase. I am so far very glad on the outcome.",Postif
"Just got this phone ... Upgraded from a LG Aristo 2. I'm a MetroPCS customer ..... Swapping service to new phone was simple as well as transferring apps...simple
The phone display is so vivid .. the fingerprint thingy is quick. Love love love this phone. Didn't want a contract to get an iPhone or Galaxy. Great price 4 a Great device !!! Definitely recommend this phone for bargain hunters ??",Postif
The charging port is not USB Type C which is a real bummer. Anyone who has converted to the Type C connector will know how much better it is. I just converted most of my cables to Type C and when this phone arrived I was shocked to see the antiquated micro USB connector that is a decade old. Yikes.,Postif
"I LOVE this phone..
The best budget phone, I've owned thus far.
1. The fingerprint scanner opens faster than any budget Samsung device I previously owned, and it's easily accessible compared to budget Samsung devices.
2. The display... AMAZING
3. SPEED!!! It's really quick
4. Space... Unbelievable for the price.
I'm completely happy with my phone.

The only draw back is the camera, while it's way better than other Samsung budget phones... It's not that gr8. But all things considering, I got really good specs on a budget & I don't regret it.

Thank you Huawei??",Postif
"I've had this phone for around 4 months now and couldn't have asked for more in this price range. I have always bought mid-range phones, trying for the biggest bang for my money. For it's price, this phone stands out. Processing power, RAM and ROM capacity. The most impressive feature for me is it's camera and display. Picture quality is fantastic, each picture taken is over 5 MB in size illustrating the amount of detail captured. Display is sharp and crisp! A happy customer.",Postif
I love this phone. It feels well made. I've had not problems with it in the three months I've had it. Camera is pretty good for the price of the phone- especially if the subject is well lit. Not as good at night but I didn't buy it for night photography so that's not really an issue for me.,Postif
"I got this phone and I was really excited!
Here I can tell you some of my opinion about the huawei
pros:
*Beautiful photos
*Beautiful phone
*Nice resolution
* Just need to put the active sim and it works
/ unlock with your finger

cons:
* it take fooorever to charge the phone, I would say like 5-6 hours to have 90% of battery
* Its not compatible with Fitbit, Garmin, and some headphones
( I am really sad and disappointed because I have a fitbit and a Garmin and my Bluetooth earphones I can only use it with the tablet so I can only use regular headphones
* Because you have so many apps it get really slow",Postif
"I've never owned a phone that cost over $130 so buying this one was a ""splurge"" for me. I caught it on sale earlier this week for $220 and I'd definitely say it's worth the extra money spent. Fast response times, excellent call clarity, nice design... If you're on the fence like I was because of the extra money, just get it. You'll be glad you did.",Postif
"I've had this phone for about a month now and love it. Has the quality of the type of product others are spending upwards of $700 on. Overall, amazingly fast, no crashes at all, can use intensily all day long running a bunch of things at once and still have at least 60% at the end of the day. Camera takes great photos, struggles a little in low light without flash, but what camera doesn't. Photos in natural light come out brilliantly. Runs Bluetooth flawlessly - works great with my ticwatch and uconnect. No issues at all with T-Mobile - put SIM card in, logged in to Google and everything was transferred quickly and seamlessly from old htc phone. I highly recommend it.",Postif
"I love this phone. It's my first Android and it's beautiful. Graphics are great. Huge memory. It's unlocked for overseas travel. Big bright beautiful screen. The battery life is phenomenal in ""Ultra power saving mode"" I mean phenomenal. It's got a really great camera. And the price!!! Wow!
Goodbye forever Apple!",Postif
"Just got it at weekend and now is using this new phone ... Impressively moved by its high quality phone material and great looking design, lighting speed finger ID unlock feature, and long lasting battery, and sharp display image ( but weak point is when you use it at outdoor with sun Glasses on , hardly to see the displayed contents ) , and smooth app response, and great speaker sound quality , camera looks good and I think it has more space to improve , and so many other great features ( so far I don't have not have enough time to check all yet) ...
Anyway, back to the POINT : This is phone is really worth to buy compare with other phones, it is really close to other expensive phones in quality and feature wise but the price is only 1/3 compare with these ''supper expensive phones - i & S '' ( I am these phones user too at same time ).
GO Wow Way, expecting you bring more excitements to this market.",Postif
I love this phone!! Us government doesn't like it because it can shut down their secret little running processes. I almost never loose battery power..I hate Google running my life Soo this phone takes care of that. I can get into settings that u normally can't in any other Android phone. For a serious technical person this phone is great. If not too techy stick with the smell of apples..thanks Huawei for standing up to the big dogs,Postif
"Great phone. Bought for wife. She's had no complaints. Fast enough. Good storage amount with Microsd expansion available, which is harder to find. No alot of case options, but get one. Doal camera for portrait mode gives so-so results. Primary camera in standard mode is better. Fingerprint sensor is fast and handy. UI is fast and unobtrusive.",Postif
"Over all good phone if you don't need it for navigation or Pokemon Go, etc etc. The GPS/antenna on this phone is straight garbage. Really disappointed in it.",Negatif
"Never thought I would need it, but just started a job in a dead spot (AT&T service). The phone doesn't have Wifi calling...I never have needed it in the past many years / decade...

Also, for some reason, my phone and tablet has a problem loading ""weather.com"" but does fine everywhere else. Really weird...if I stop the browser and then refresh, it usually goes through. Other than these, pretty legit phone / tablet (Huawei MediaPad M5)",Postif
"Just got the phone the other day, so far so good. Only giving it 4 stars because I haven't had it long so I can't write a super detailed review. Much faster than my old phone (blackview), holds a charge well, gets good service, I like the layout and the setup of the features. Great camera! That's a big selling point for me and the pictures come out great and it has some cool features to play with like stickers, manual camera settings and some great editing options. Optional additional storage is great too. So far I really like this phone and would definitely recommend it.",Postif
I have had this phone for almost 3 weeks now and find it to be exceptional. It is the best phone I have ever owned. Picture and sound quality are superior. Reception and call quality are great either with or without my Blutooth headphones. The functionality and overall performance is on par with the most expensive cell phones available. I cannot believe it cost me less than 300 dollars and performs as well as any IPhone or top dollar Android device available. Well worth the money and I will remain a Huawei customer in the future.,Postif
"So I took the plunge and went for it. I also use Mint Mobile and the sim started working as soon as I put it in and restarted the phone. This thing seems to be awesome so far. Very solid phone, not the fastest processor I suppose but way faster than anything I have gotten from Metro PCS or Boost. The RAM is also its strongest point. Its amazing and the large screen with small bezzles allow me to read my kindle app with ease.",Postif
Great phone for the value. Picture and battery life are fantastic. Sounds could be a bit better but it's not too horrible. Fast speeds and connects with Cricket Wireless with zero issues. I'm very happy with my purchase.,Postif
"I like the design the look
I love everything about this phone except that it does not work on Boost.
I called Huawei customer support and they said that at the moment it only works on the T-Mobile Network because the government is telling companies to not support this brand
I'm sorry Huawei but im gonna have to return this.",Negatif
"Love this phone have had a couple months now and it's functioning as promised. It exceeds all my expectations. Good sound, awesome camera, great amount of storage for all my needs. Had a note 2 before and a honor 6 but finally ended up with this phone and it was a good fit for me.",Postif
"The phone is top-notch. Plenty fast enough, the screen is sharp & the sound isn't terrible. The main camera is pretty good, the front facing camera is on par with other phone maker's offerings. Definitely got our money's worth with our purchase. We bought two, the wife got the white/gold one that is quite sharp. I got the other one, black/slate.",Postif
"It is absolutely amazing phone for the price point. It has a nice display, it's fast, has plenty of storage, feels solid, and has Android Oreo. The camera works great in good lighting, but is the phones weak link. The rear camera struggles in low light and the front camera is decent. The bottom line is a better phone will cost at least double.This phone is better than my OnePlus 2 it replaced. Including the camera.",Postif
"I had been using a service provider smartphone before this. It had 8gb of storage and was slow beyond conparison. I have been very satisfied with this phone. It is sturdy, crisp, relatively light, thin enough, and for the price i cannot complain. In fact I have actively tried to convince others to get this if they were looking for a new phone. Huawei has its own version on android called EMUI 8.0. This version has a lot of neat features like in the camera app where you can take switch from multiple different modes to get what you want. All around it is a great phone. While i do not like what Huawei does with user information and i think it is terrible, for someone like me, i have nothing that is sensitive so it doesn't affect me. All around great phone, would and will recomend (and no i am not paid by Huawei to say these things, just a satisfied customer)",Postif
This is my phone I use now. I love it. It works well. I'm only 21 but I feel like 80 when it comes to new technology. This phone has a lot and bells and whistles that I don't use. But I think it's pretty cool.,Postif
"This phone works just as well, if not better than my iPhone 7plus. Its the exact same size. Its a beautiful phone and so far havent had any issues running apps on it. Bought this as a gift for my daughter who needed a new device and I didnt want to spend $600+ on an iOS or Samsung phone. She plays ROBLOX and AJPW on it and it runs smoothly. We only use it on WiFi, no phone plan on it, but theres plenty of free messaging apps that can be used to text and make calls with other android and iOS devices. We love how fast the fingerprint ID technology works on it. I always have issues with my own iPhone. Totally worth the price!",Postif
"Had the phone for about a week. Works well, no problems. Very happy with the quality of the phone...

Update: have used the phone for about 2 month now. The only problem I have had is that it locks up for some reason and then it takes 2 to 5 minutes before it resets. I haven't messed with removing the battery and now that I know what happens I guess it's not a big deal. For under $200 it's a small thing to deal with.",Postif
"Do not buy this phone if you use Verizon for phone service. After much to do, this phone was found to be unusable on my Verizon contract. I wish Amazon would've noted that, Very disappointing.",Negatif
"Replaced a G5s which replaced a HTC 10.. The G5s is 3 months old.. This phone is better in my opinion than the g5s due to the fact that for the same price it has Android 8.... My HTC 10 was bought in Dec. 2016 and got 8 in January 2018...!!!

For the price range phone runs great.

Dont like the huawei bottom lock screen (i.e no slide right on bottom to unlock, brings up a MENU!) Still figuring out in themes how to change it.",Postif
"I've had this phone just about a month and I'm really loving it. I like that I have more memory and storage as that was my primary reason to purchase. The battery life is good, the picture quality is good and the sound is OK. All features considered, I think it's a good buy.",Postif
"After quite a bit of research I decided to buy this phone even though I had obstacles such as AT&T deciding not to sell it then Best Buy doing the same. I came here, saw it, bought it and, after a few months in, am quite satisfied. No 5-star rating since it doesn't have OIS or NFC. The fact that it only has 2.4GHz WiFi isn't an issue. Who needs a $900 phone anyway?!",Postif
"This phone appears to outperform my Pixel XL for about 1/5 the cost. It replaced a defective LG 5 phone and there is no fair comparison between the two of them. Battery life is insane...at evening, battery power is still about 75%. It does everything exceptionally well. I highly recommend this phone at any price and for under $250? Wow! Nothing else can touch it!",Postif
"After 8 months of use I do not have any type of phone complaint. The life of the battery is very good, the phone works very well and never stays stuck. the camera is not the best of the phone but it works correctly. This phone will be with me for at least 4 years.",Postif
"I got this phone for my wife. She uses it on T-Mobile. The sound is up to expectation for cell phones. The pictures are not as good as my Samsung smartphone generates, or my daughter's iPhone, but they're still OK.
We like the battery life - when running with a 4G signal, we can get almost two days of use between charge. The battery is quite good.",Postif
"Overall works great. I use USMobile as my carrier. Was able to transfer data from old phone no problem.
Cons:
Sound works fine but sometimes have a hard time hearing ring tone
No fun themes
Pros
Big screen
Fast connection n surfing
Lock screen options

Would recommend",Postif
I could lower the cost using freedompop sim. I use Google hangout for talk instead of crap freedom pop app.,Postif
"Actually a pretty good phone for the price. I was disappointed that Huawei stopped providing bootloader unlocks for these devices, but for what it is stock it's a good phone. Great camera and with an octocore processor it is very fast. Fingerprint sensor responds immediately and facelock was a cool feature too. I don't care for the speaker placement for playing games because holding this phone in landscape makes you cover it. Gaming is pretty good but I did expect better performance in 3D games. So far battery life is good to average although when this phone is in standby there is almost zero drain. Comes with a clear case which is cool till you get what you want.",Postif
"just received this phone and so far, really impressed with it. I came from an s6 and I am pleasantly surprised with this phone. I really don't care about the technology hype, this phone is fulfilling its task and more. I would definitely recommend it.",Postif
"Nice phone, very fast, and the power is longer than others.",Postif
"It has great spec, incredible value. The only thing I dont like is the micro usb charger port. Huawei Honor 8 introduced in 2016 already has usb c charger port.

Now the best part is the metal case. It is extremely light weight. IMHO, this is the one reason to get this phone. I own Huawei Honor 8 and it has a glass case. Most of the more expensive phones use either glass or crematic for the case. They are heavy and they break easily when you drop your phone accidentally. So you are paying more for expensive phones by having greater risks.

Am I a fan of Huaweis phones? Not yet. I own Huawei Honor 8 and its battery went bad in 11 months, So I will update the review of Mate SE a year from now.

In addition, for USA, Huawei 7X and Huawei Mate SE are similar but Mate SE is better.

US version Mate SE = International version of 7X

US version of 7X. = Trimmed spec of the international version of 7X",Postif
"I love it, and for the price!!!!!! Great!!!!!!!!!!!!.....No contact or extra bills for an expensive phone that will do the same things this one will...",Postif
"So far, I like the phone very much. My only complaint so far is, when I am finished with a call and bring the phone down in front of me, the screen is dark, so I can't hang up, with out pushing the button to turn the screen on. Otherwise very fast response time. Lots of space and memory.",Postif
"How beautiful, all huawei devices, they work better then anything on th market, plus they have so much hidden -, would blow the your mind, Huawei love you",Postif
"Let me preface this by saying I never write reviews for Amazon purchase unless they really stand out. I bought this as an upgrade from a terribly slow (but also very cheap) smartphone - Blu 5.0 Advance. The difference is astounding. The call quality, speaker, and camera are great. The phone is very quick. I have no problems using apps like Snapchat without any lagging issues. Please note that this phone can only use nano sim cards (1 nano sim and a micro SD or 2 nano sims). If you're hesitating to buy, make the jump you won't regret it. I did a lot of research on phones under $300, and this is the best bang for your buck. Best purchase I've made in recent memory.",Postif
"I loved this phone .. but will save and buy another ..It constantly makes calls by itself.
I had first thought it was something I was doing ..but...it can be in my purse or just next to me....The speaker phone also does not work....With all the wonderful reviews I guess I just got a lemon",Negatif
"I am very happy with my decision to purchase the Huawei Mate SE, very happy! I love how responsive it is to my commands, how I'm able to stream a movie and watch the movie without it having to buffer all the time. Nothing worse than interruption, right? The 4 gig of RAM allows me to actually multi-task on my Smart phone! Facial reconition and how about the fingerprint identification system that unlocks in a super sonic 0.2 seconds? Yeah, that's what i'm talkin about! Yeah, I'm pretty excited as you can tell and I could go on but I don't wanna bore you. Take my word, I'm 63 years young you should buy one too. I promise you won't be dissapointed.
Sincerely,
Buck James ""1955""",Postif
"I bought this phone because my iPhone 6 died after getting wet, and I didn't want to spend almost $700 (or whatever they're ridiculous prices are) for a new phone and a used one was almost $300.

So far I've had it for 3 months and have zero complaints. The screen resolution and size is great and the camera is on point. It takes better pictures than the iPhone in my opinion. I don't have a problem with WiFi and Bluetooth which I know some people complained about. I use them all the time at the same time and it works great. The battery life is also really great. It will usually last me about 1 1/2 days and sometimes 2 if I'm not on it a lot.

In all honesty the phone is great and the price is unbeatable.",Postif
"This is a very good phone for the price. I use it with a pre-paid carrier, and there was no problem in setting it up. For the routine usage of a smart phone, like calling, text messaging, taking pictures, and downloading/playing games, videos, music, and podcasts, it does its job. It is responsive and runs smoothly. No problem with different Wi-Fi connections. I do find the camera focusing function tricky, but I do not use this phone often for pictures.",Postif
"This is perhaps the best phone I have ever owned at a fraction of what I used to pay for Samsung, LG and iPhone.

It is fast and most importantly battery last 2 days with heavy use. If you don't mind no wifi calling, the this the phone to have. You can't go wrong with that price.",Postif
"1. Super fast processor
2. super fast fingerprint sensor
3. High resolution, 2k
4. Good camera
5. Huge storage
6. Very cheap compared to parallel phones",Postif
"The minus 1 star is mainly for the shipping. There was no packaging in the shipping box so the contents were moving around inside. For a delicate device like this I'd have expected better considerations. Thankfully the phone seems to have survived anything that might have befell it.

I'm upgrading from a Galaxy S5 so this is a major overall improvement for me. Thought I'd give another brand a try.
The features are as described. For the price this is not bad. I paid $300 for my S5 back in 2015 and the Mate SE is less than that.... I'll definitely consider upgrading with this brand later on if the Mate SE does a good Job.",Postif
"After trying one of these phones I bought two more for people in our office. For the first four months the phone was great, now all of us have different problems with the OS not communicating with the phone. In my phone the setting will say Mobile Data is turned on, along with roaming, and enabled 4GLTE. Yet When i go to use the an internet dependent application they are not working because I am offline. I will restart the phone and the applications will work again for a period of time.
Overall it is a well constructed phone, but everyone of us is having problems with how the phone interacts with the operating system.",Negatif
"I'm absolutely delighted by this phone, as of the price and its specs, you won't get better deal other than this. My previous phone was also Huawei, it worked perfectly fine. Highly recommend this phone.",Postif
"So I've had this phone for six months now the quality is great pictures come out great it has lots of space but for some reason my headphone jack doesn't work well . I plug them in and the music just plays out loud. Gave me a reason to buy blutooth headphones though
Also this phone no matter how much i dropped it never cracked. unfortunately yesturday i had a fit of rage slammed it to the floor and stomped on it over and over again. Of course its ruined and i feel like a complete idiot but ive already purchased a new one and am working on my anger issues.
Dont stomp on your phone guys",Postif
"This phone is a freak of technology for the price point! I ordered on a Friday and received it on Sunday! Unboxed it, immidiately did the system update and been zipping and zooming ever since! It's lightning fast, the camera is amazing and the Battery is outstanding! I watched Netflix for 4hrs straight and still had 70%. The finger print and facial recognition response time is pheonominal! The only negative thing I can relatively find to say about this phone is that I have a hard time with some of my wireless Bluetooth headphones but other then that, if you want a Galaxy Quality phone for $250 this phone is your answer!",Postif
"Great phone so far. This one I got for my brother and he loves it. I have been using Honor 8 for two years and I didn't have even one issue with it. That's why we decided to get another Huawei phone. This one looks very solid, bigger screen, faster and you cannot beat the price. I always wonder why people pay nowadays $1000 if you can get a better phone for just under $300, plus unlocked???",Postif
"Amazing phone for the value. With 4GB of Ram, I have yet to encounter any issues with the system slowing down, or overheating. The screen is bright and vibrant with great contrast. I love the night mode where it dampens the colors to not strain your eyes at night. The battery will give you a full day of use, easy. The cameras are top notch, with a show motion video option that's actually pretty cool. The only downside to this phone is it uses a micro USB, not a type C. So there's no quick charge option. But other than that. It's a great phone.",Postif
"I love the camera on this phone. I don't know much about technology but this phone is awesome for the price. I use YouTube, Netflix, WhatsApp and many other apps on this phone and it has never slowed down. The battery life is awesome too.",Postif
"I love this brand and this phone. The camera wasn't as good as what I am used to so I returned it. I have an lg v20 & an lg v10. I loved EMUI also. I must say that i miss the unique features of this phone such as the screen recorder and scrolling screenshot built right in. I haven't found anything in the appstore that gives me these features without a headache. The phone itself was premium build and had an excellent UI that worked flawlessly with google. My lg's won't use Google's ""routines"" properly. I didn't have this problem on the Mate SE. If the camera isnt a huge deal, then you'll love this phone. I give the camera a 6 out of 10 but the phone a 9 out of 10. This is bc of the awesome UI and the ease of updates. My lg phones never get updates EVER.",Postif
"This is one quality phone. It is a much better phone than the one I had before (LG). I've only had the phone for under 2 months and its working fine so far. Only a small issue with notifications. It seems notices can occasionally get delayed. Apparently according to my research, this is due to the EMUI's aggressive battery savings setting. Don't know for a fact if that's true. So far, I have not missed any important notifications (only delayed).",Postif
"Wow I love this phone! It's huge! It has so many features, great picture taking and I've had zero problems with it! I got this as a birthday gift and I'm sooo happy with it! Only silly complaint is the lack of cute cases for it but seriously this phone is awesome!",Postif
"I have had the phone for about 2 weeks. So far it has been good to me. I am pretty happy with it. I will comment more as time goes.

September 18, 2018: after using the phone for a couple of months, l love it! l just bought another one with a price even cheaper for my son. You cannot go wrong with this phone.",Postif
"Love it so far. If this Mate SE lasts, it is a great value. I will make it a point to re-post on this if it fails. Just like the S9. I am very happy. Fast, 4k, and lots of everything. Work perfect with AT&T service and has all the""AMERICAN"" settings and APPs.",Postif
"I've been using this phone for 3 months. It was fine at first. Happy with the cost, storage, speed. Phone calls are fine, had to buy a customizable messaging app because the built in Messaging is terrible. Issues with app compatibility are growing every week. I am not sure if it's an Android, Google, or Huawei issue but it's getting very annoying. The Google location tracking doesn't stay up to date, keeps telling me it's off, timeline doesn't show where I've been or when. Multiple issues with connectivity on Bluetooth. My music app has decided to play my notification sound between every track, cannot resolve! It's like this phone has a mind of its own. Will go back to a Google phone as soon as I can afford it. Hassles are not worth the savings to me.",Negatif
Galaxy killer........this phone is amazing...well worth the coins....super fast and comes with anti virus preinstalled...... cameras are Rock solid.....I dig the fact you can zoom your videos to full screen....they even have laptops from this company....good job Huawei,Postif
"Love this phone!!! I was awaiting the oneplus 6 but when it took too long to launch, I decided on a more affordable phone. I have no regrets. Phone looks and feels good. It has a few problems when I'm typing too fast and the key pad is slow to respond but besides that, I can't complain. I love the finger print unlock as well. Still loving this phone!!! I was very pleased with my purchase. I got more than I bargained for.",Postif
"It's just 2G network compatible, it is not detecting my 5G network SSID.",Negatif
This phone is very economical and yet it feels and works like an expensive phone like a Samsung flagship or even an iPhone. The build is quality and so is the screen. The phone is not a slouch by any means and it takes the best budget I have ever purchased. The screen resolution does not have the Oled screen that I love with Samsung but it still has a beautiful screen. All in all this is a good buy for someone wanting a quality phone for a fraction of the price.,Postif
"This is a beautiful phone for the price. It's fast and has a great fingerprint sensor. The only thing is I'm not sold on the 18/9 screen. My Sony Xperia xa Ultra has a 16/9 and just looks like a much bigger screen ( even though the Huawei is only slightly smaller)when watching videos. I know this is the new thing, but new isn't always better. So if your just a fad junkie ( hopefully this is just a fad) this will be your cup of tea. Why phone companies are always changing things that aren't broke, like removable batteries, headphone jacks, need to have a Sim ejector tool just to remove your SD card. I blame these changes on Samsung and Apple, all the other phone companies are just followers. Back to the phone - if you like the 18/9 and don't want to pay a fortune for a phone with a nice screen, great fingerprint reader, and decent camera and battery life this is the phone for you.",Postif
"It's a great budget phone. Something I love from the Chinese phone is that the user interface, the applications that run on it are very well designed, something that for example Samsung does not. What we can do in these phones with their native applications can be achieved in Samsung phones by installing third-party applications.",Postif
"I like it so far but a lot of space on the phone was already taken up by the system and preset apps which was very annoying. Otherwise it's a solid phone so far.

Update:
I have had this phone for almost a year now, and I am pretty happy with my purchase. There are a few issues, but they are minor issues the most people have with technology, such has apps freezing etc. I had these same issues when I had higher end Samsung products, so I expected as much from this phone.",Postif
"compared to iphone 6s, just a tiny bit slower. Face and fingerprint recognition are lightning fast. Very light and thin. Picture quality is excellent. sound and speaker mode for calls are nice and crisp. I use it with a tracfone micro sd card. no issue to report.",Postif
"This phone is something I needed to buy because my last phone got water damage. It was very affordable. However, I was going to switch form AT&T to Verizon, but the phone is NOT Verizon. Just letting you guys know before you buy and have Verizon. Besides this slight hiccup, phone is great.",Postif
Upgrade from honor 5. Simple data transfer. Fast fast phone!! Polital govt. Hysterics on Chinese ties seems absurd given that nearly all our phones are made there.,Postif
Just recieved phone and took it to metro pcs only to find out that it is not compatible. Confused because every review has stated the phone is compatible?,Postif
The phone worked perfectly with ATT 4G LTE speeds and it looks amazing. The sound quality wasn't the absolute greatest but I was also switching phones from an HTC M9 which has unbelievable sound so I can't complain. Looks and feels great in the hands. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Waaayyy better than paying $700+ for a new phone.,Postif
I don't like that it doesn't support ac wireless standards. It works well in everything else.,Postif
This phone is amazing! Especially for the price (it's almost unreal). So happy with this purchase!,Postif
Thank you amazon finally i got my choice and good quality phone. This item works every thing great fast super smart i love HAUWAI mate.,Postif
"I was so scared not to buy another samsung but the reviews convinced me,so glad I did, so far the only negative I can think of it is not quite as loud as my note 4 ok for me but couldn't pass it on to my husband he is hard of hearing",Postif
"My phone was working great, but then today I woke up to it dead even though I had it charged it in all night. I have tried multiple outlets, multiple chargers. It won't charge. I can't return it because it became non-returnable two days ago. I can't force reboot since it's already dead.",Negatif
"After 2 months, I'm still in love with this phone. I love the graphics of this phone, the available memory and the speed of the processor. But the best part was that I accidentally submerged this phone fully in water for several minutes and it still works great! And the fingerprint sensor on the back is perfect for getting into my phone quickly! I've had high end and low end phones and by far this is my favorite phone I've ever had.",Postif
"Just installed Oreo 8.0,,,bonza! Best phone bang for the buck, speedy with great screen resolution. Used to be iPhone bloke, no more!",Postif
"I have a Huawei mate 9 and this compares very favorable to a phone that cost several hundred dollars more. Some of the features are slightly down scale, but the quality is generally outstanding. Bought this to have a a cheap second phone and it turns out only the price is cheap. Highly recommend it.",Postif
"I have not one bad thing to say about this phone. I wasn't familiar with the company and I usually don't buy brands I don't know, but I was desperate for a new phone and this was a pretty good price! It's fast, the screen is super clear, and the camera is great! It's a wonderful phone for a really good price!",Postif
"I just got this phone on Monday. With the quality of material, features and speed, this price point is unbeatable. Also, I went almost 36 hours without charging it and I still had at least a quarter battery left. If you need a phone that is up for the task and doesn't need frequent charges, I can't recommend this enough.
I will say that the fingerprint sensor is kind of annoying, though. It won't recognize my pointer finger so I had to go in and add more fingerprints and even those being recognized is pretty hit or miss. But that might just be my device.",Postif
It is really fantastic. I searched a lot before buying this phone. And all positive reviews are true!! There is no reason to hesitate to buy this phone.,Postif
"Phone is great for your basic everyday functions such as calls, text, emails, youtube, social media such as facebook, Instagram,.Snapchat, Twitter etc. The camera is pretty good. Has a lot of different photo modes, filters & options. Overall phone graphics could be better. The battery life is exceptional!! I can go a day or two without charging it. The phone is also very durable. I've dropped mine numerous times & their was no damage done to the phone at all fortunately. The Speaker phone sounds somewhat low to me when I use it. Overall For $239 or $249. This is a great phone!",Postif
"This device is very fast and very smooth. Easily the best experience I've had on an Android device. This phone birngs you flagship level specs without breaking the bank. Don't let the price throw you off. There is no lag. Cameras are absolutely gorgeous. Fingerprint scanner is instant. And that 3340 mAh battery keeps you charged all day, even under decently heavy use. That Kirin 659 Octa-Core CPU can handle everything you throw at it with incredible speed and realibility. The onboard EMUI is very responsive with no lag. Currently Android 7.0 out of the box with 8.0 on the way. Do not hesitate another second. But this phone. You will NOT be disappointed!!",Postif
"I really like this phone way faster than the Galaxy for sure , the signal still sucks but that's because AT&T just sucks, but the phone is really good, screen has a good size and good resolution 4Gb in ram and 64Gb in memory it makes it even better , totally recommend this phone",Postif
"We bought this phone four and a half months ago. The ratio price / quality is sooo good so two weeks ago without any hesitation, we bought a second one. The phone so far works amazing. It is fast, very good screen quality, the battery is lasting for the entire day, very good picture quality ( not the best). Amazing low budget phone.",Postif
"I bought the 64gb version; it came with more free space than I was expecting from a phone, always nice. It doesn't have the Facebook app pre-installed; a bonus for myself, as when a phone comes with it already built in, you can't uninstall it.

I purchased this along with the other recommended items. The phone itself already came with a clear case, so I ended up with an extra case. I had no problems with my SIM card; inserted it into the Huawei and it was ready to go.",Postif
I'm tired of spending so much money every year or so on phone uupgrade. After searching for a while this is the best bargain you can get with these specs for a low price. Good battery life. Screen is clear and sound is good.,Postif
"I was very pleased with functionality, look and battery. My satisfaction went down the drain when I dropped my phone 3 ft on wood floor. AND protection on ! Screen blew in a million pieces..price to repair $120 . I had a BlackBerry before, was not too pleased with the functionality and that is why I changed to this model. What a costly mistake. I have dropped my BlackBerry a dozen times and it survived without a scratch. This Huawei Mate should be labeled : only use indoors on thick carpet floors.",Negatif
"This phone has lots of the features of even the newest i-phones, but at a much better price.",Postif
The only downsides for me are lack of 5GHz WiFi and the main camera is only average. This is an excellent mid-range phone for a budget price. Excellent battery life. And it even includes a skin case.,Postif
"After one month, I couldn't be happier. Outperforms the iphone 8 at about 1/3 the price. The only downside is that it doesn't have wireless charging, but given the 3,000 vs 1,821 mah battery, its a moot point.",Postif
This is a great phone for the money. It has a very good processor that works flawlessly.,Postif
"This is our second purchase. The first one was bought in July and I'm happy with the speed, camera quality, and battery time. Plus, the phone is not heavy, and it came with a protective case.",Postif
"Had this product for many months now and have loved using it so far. Very snappy and great value for the price. I recently noticed my fingerprint sensor not registering very well and called Huawei's customer service, and they instantly let me send the item to them for repair free of charge and with free shipping! :)",Postif
So freaking this phone has been great. Really fast has not lagged or frozen one bit. I wish it had USB typ C charging but still charges decently fast. Battery life if GREAT I'm on it most of th day and does NOT drain the battery fast like my prior phone!,Postif
Great device for the price. Perfect phone for a parent who doesn't need alot of bells and whistles but still needs something reliable,Postif
"Excellent value in an inexpensive phone. Not as nice as a Galaxy S7 but kess than one-half the price. Battery life has been excellent too. Audio quality is very clear. Seems to be fairly durable, did buy protective case and glass shield.",Postif
"Very fast and looks great, haven't had any issues so far. Rear camera is great, front not so much. Good storage with the option of a micro SD card.",Postif
"Wonderful device, wouldn't choose any other phone at this price point! only issue i see currently after about a month of usage is that the speaker is not terrible but not pleasant to listen to, and there must be something up with the amp inside the phone for the headphone jack because after a strip of audio has been played there is a noticeably annoying static and hiss.",Postif
This one great phone. In this price you cannot get any smart phone with this high performance. I really recommend that to everyone. I got 2 more when get this one thanks I dont have buy iPhone or similar price phones anymore,Postif
"The Huawei mate se phone is excellent. I am still trying to figure some features. But I love my new phone. The pictures the quality is great. But the only thing is the sound quality . I have to put volume up on high. Especially the price is affordable. Although I wanted to go with another carrier, this phone is only compatible with GSM which is AT&T or T- Mobile. I would really recommend you try to buy and see for yourself.",Postif
"To be honest, I was skeptical about this phone because of the almost perfect reviews its was getting for a budget phone. For a budget phone in 2018, this phone does almost everything my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 does but actually works when I try to make calls and texts others unlike my Note 5. After using this phone for about 4 days now, I can honestly say that it is worth the purchase for those who are looking for a phone that works very well when needed.",Postif
"Don't Buy!!!!!!
Wasted your money!!!
I give 0 start... Buy not even a month
Freeze , camara not working, sent to fix
Say my phone liquid damage!!!
My phone not even has a drip or drop....
Call again they say can't fix it in ????,
Mean have to throw the phone away.
HUAWEI????????????",Negatif
"For the most part, the phone was very good, But the EMUI feature would not allow Apps that I needed to run in the background, to work properly.",Postif
"Both my wife and I have used this phone for over half a year. This phone is pretty fast and reliable compared to my last phone, a Samsung note 5. The battery life is especially amazing. So far, I only reached to 20% of the battery once when I watched Netflix for a few episodes. The only drawback is the picture quality, especially under low light. But it's good enough for taking regular pictures without too much zoom in.",Postif
I have been looking at phones for awhile and this sat on my wish list the longest. I love this phone and adore the price. I came from an Iphone6 plus and it was easy to switch to android and honestly the space plus battery life blew my mind. Add that it takes good pictures and handles excellently... It's amazing,Postif
"This is the second Huawei unlocked cell phone I bought. Both phones are great.
This phone has big screen and runs very fast. It is easy to use and very functonal.
My husband is using Samsung galaxy 7 and I have to say, this phone if it is not better than his, must be as good as his Samsung.
It is great phone from any perspective!!!",Postif
"Quick, Sleek

So far, so good!
Intuitive, fast. Sleek design! Not the best camera good enough.
Only complaint is the way they package the item- no bubble wrap:) Just the small Huawei box inside. Should be sent properly packed since esp for a phone. No damage. Thankfully! 4+",Postif
"Great phone for thr price. Fast and navigation is smooth. Even got it with Android 7, upgraded to 8 after switched on.",Postif
"I am in love with this product. The fingerprint identification that is used to unlock the phone is fast! It really is an unlocked phone. The instructions inside the package was easy to follow, and I was able to set up the phone in minutes. You can also unlock the phone with pin or the dots. This is a fantastic Android phone! It also comes with a phone case. I wish it also came with a screen protector or at least where I can buy a screen protector for the phone. Either way, I am in love with this phone.",Postif
"I love this phone. I was pleasantly surprised by the user experience. I am a first time user of Huawei and I'm sold. There is no need for me to purchase an iPhone again. I'm not knocking anyone, but this phone gets the job done at a fraction of the cost. It has a decent camera and storage.",Postif
I just love my phone. I fell in love with it as soon as I got it in my hands. I'd also buy another one in the future. I like Huawei.,Postif
El equipo est nuevo y funciona muy bien,Postif
"I bought this as a present and they loved it. I loved it. You'll love it. For the price, it'll be hard to find better. It does not come with headphones but I usually buy better ones anyway.",Postif
"I have been always a BlackBerry user and Android user but this time ""emui"" got me with its oreo version, am in love with this cell phone, it's just more than what you can expect from a budget, am actually gonna buy huawei flagship am impressed with this piece of equipment and you should give it a try I know you won't regret it",Postif
It's just like an iPhone only much cheaper. I purchased this one for my mother. I bought one directly from the company a fee years back and it's still performing well.,Postif
Huawei has a lot of features at an exceptional price.....,Postif
Very nice phone for the price. Has a lot of high end functions that you would not expect from a 200 dollar phone. Why pay 1000 dollars when you can get the same quality and functions in this very well built phone.,Postif
"I've had three Samsung Galaxy phones over the years, all of which had poor battery life. I can go days without charging this one, and it has everything I need in a phone.",Postif
This phone is not truly unlocked between cricket and I we still cannot get it to send or receive pictures and there are areas in your phone you cannot access. What a waste of Money..,Negatif
"The Huawei Mate SE is a FANTASTIC phone at this price point. You get an amazing screen, phenomenal storage, RAM for days, and a stupefying processor. Everyday tasks are smooth as butter and gaming is fun.

Simply put, this is the best phone to get at this price.

For those of you on Cricket Wireless, set up is a breeze. Simply put the nano dim from your phone into this one. While this phone does accept two SIM cards I used one of the slots as an SD card slot.",Postif
"Fantastic phone, amazing specs and fantastic price.",Postif
"I love this phone. After my htc got damaged I asked my IT guy what phone would he suggget as a replacement. I wanted to try something new. He suggested an iPhone or Huawei. I went with the Huawei and am very pleased. Phone fast and graphics sharp. I also like the quick photo feature with the volume button. I like photos.

Would definitely recommend.",Postif
"I'm praying this cell doesn't just freeze n die on me. I really like the phone and have a card in for Xtra space. For the money, as good as my old Samsung 5. Why pay that much for a new cell. Again, praying it doesn't just die after my 60 days which is on 4 days. Great cell 2day.",Postif
"I bought one of my kids the Honor 7x and one the Huawei Mate SE. Both are great, low cost and beautiful phones. From the outside, the only difference I can see is the color and the camera housing being a single piece on the Mate SE. You can definitely tell the Mate is a little more responsive with the extra RAM. If you weren't already aware, there are some big limitations to these phones. You can only connect to 2.4Ghz wireless and Bluetooth shares an antenna with wifi, which means you get slower performance on wifi when using blootooth. You also don't get fast charging or USB type C, which really isn't a huge deal to me. It seems to charge fast enough. The body is a great size and it really does look very pretty overall. For kids who want something that looks good, but you won't be too concerned about losing or breaking, this is a great option and one I would recommend. At the current price of $230, the extra 30 dollars is worth it over the 7x for the extra memory/storage.",Postif
It's a great phone with plenty of storage for me and it's super fast but my only issue is once you get the update added to the phone my messages will stop showing on messenger unless I restart the phone,Postif
GREAT BATTERY LIFE! Nice size screen.,Postif
"This is an awesome phone especially for the price. I needed a new phone, works with At&t, has great storage and has a pretty fast processor. I read the reviews thoroughly before purchasing and I'm glad I bought it. The camera takes decent pics but not like the newest phones out there. Charges fast which is a plus!",Postif
"in this price, it is having all the features that any good phone should have. it is running very smooth with multiple applications open. the only lagging area that i could figure out is its sound quality, which is not bad but not good as i thought. Apart from that, everything else is perfectly fine with this phone.
If you are looking for any budget phone with all the running features, then this should be the best option i could find.",Postif
Purchased back in May this phone is one of the better phones I have had. I'm now starting to have problems with the finger print sensor.,Postif
"I like it, good performance.",Postif
"I really wanted to like this phone and initially I did. Everything about it is great except the reception. I live in a somewhat rural area and in the past I'll have to go outside to make phone calls once in a while. With this phone, even if I go outside, people always complain that I am breaking up or they can't hear me. It will show two bars but have terrible reception. When I'm in other areas I don't seem to have this problem, but it's annoying that my wife can use her phone inside our house just fine and I cannot make a call anywhere on our property when we have the same carrier.

Update:
Phone went swimming in a water bowl for a split second and screen stopped working. Given the opportunity to buy this same phone again (I already had a case and I liked that the micro USB is very popular among other devices) I opted for a different phone in the same price range and just bought a new case and a bunch of new USB c cables. I didn't want to take the risk of having a phone with poor reception issues again, so I went back to Motorola which has never let me down in that area. (Also, my new phone is waterproof, which should prevent another accident like that from happening)",Postif
Great for the price. The picture quality is ok. Not as good as my old Huawei phone which is also twice as expensive as this one. If you are particular about picture quality you may want to buy a more extensive phone. This is a basic inexpensive phone.,Postif
Love this inexpensive smart phone. Every phone is a compromise but this one has very few that matter to me. I have had it for about a month and it had been wonderful.,Postif
Very good user experience for this phone. I used iphone 3 to 6 before. And this phone is the first low price phone I purchased this may. It turns out that I am extremely satisfied with the price I paid for and this phone meets for all my needs. Would buy a similar phone in the future for someone else.,Postif
This is an amazing phone. I can't believe that I can have such a good device for a great Price. So far completely satisfied with it.,Postif
Won't work on my Verizon Network. Just another nail in the Verizon coffin for me.,Negatif
"A little bit expensive but its good, as expected. Sometimes a little bit slow while running programs and applications. Slower than an iPhone....",Postif
"Incredible phone.
Coming from an iPhone 7S, I needed a cheaper replacement.
This beast is no cheap at all.
Incredible performance, excellent battery life, premium feel, run all tasks with no problem, wonderful fingerprint sensor with multiple uses.
I'm very happy with my choice.",Postif
"Just received this phone. Very big screen, easy set up. Pretty much like any other Android phone. It's very responsive and has not skipped a beat from my prior lg g5 phone which I sent back due to a warranty issue. I love the 64 GB storage as I'm tired of fighting my lg g5 for room on the phone. Also, the battery lasts forever. It takes decent pictures but I do need a little more time with the camera to write a complete review. Over all a very surprisingly decent product!",Postif
The quality is as good as a $900 + Samsung or iPhone for under $300. A fraction of the price with just a few differeing specs. You won't regret purchasing. Also fast delivery.,Postif
"So far this is a beautiful, fast, crisp, snappy, awesome phone. The EMUI layer over regular Android is a vast improvement. Battery is great. Apps run great. Phone is great. No, really. This phone is awesome. And I feel safer having China spy on me instead of the NSA.",Postif
Really good phone for a pretty low price. Thanks China.,Postif
"Good price and good quality,my second Huawei cellphone.",Postif
I bought the phone and was happy with it initially but it will not restart and will not accept a charge. Do not waste your money and I will not buy another one of their products.,Negatif
"camera is not as good as advertised

system and screen is a little slow.screen is not good for game.",Postif
The sound comes from below so you will cover the sound from time to time. Nothing to envy a Samsung or an IPhone. Good storage. Great phone!,Postif
"Clean, quick & fits right in your hand... Easy set up for a T Mobile user... Basic Android but I'm all for Android instead of Apple. Bright & battery lasts all day",Postif
This phone is well worth the money you spend it quick and takes great pics I can't say anything bad about this phone.,Postif
So far I loved the phone and impressed with the delivery. I just received the phone this afternoon and placed the order less than 24 hours ago!,Postif
"I have had mine for two weeks. I have no issues with it. Super fast, great quality. Very very fast finger print sensor. This phone is so smooth, and in this price, it's literary the best you can get. I am so satisfied with the phone, that I have decided to buy their tablets too.",Postif
Love this brand. Best battery life of all the others.,Postif
"I'm not a huge fan of the tall thin screen shape, but it works pretty well. Specs are great for the price",Postif
"Wow! I am impressed with this phone! Easy to set up, works great. I haven't found anything I don't like about it yet (have had it for two days) and so far think it is just as good as phones that I have spent four times as much on!
Update 3 months later: Had an issue with the battery not charging. Looked at the Huawei tech support site but didn't find an answer. Started a chat and within minutes had the solution. My rating remains unchanged!",Postif
"I switched to this from Samsung S5 and I love it. Not much bloatware to deal with, fast, functional, light. Good phone for the price.",Postif
"I have been using for a few months, i have 5 emails, instagram, twitter, whatssap, telegram, and around 70 more apps, and today is working really fine, is a great based on price/quality product.",Postif
"Absolutely awesome phone for the price , tired of paying crazy money for phones just to break two years later ,",Postif
"Best phone I have ever had! Been using Blackberry for over 10 years, was a very welcome upgrade. It's hard adjusting to a touch interface e keyboard VA the qwerty keyboard, but this phone is much more compatible. Only complaint is the edges can hurt your hands after hours of prolonged use.",Postif
Make sure you are comfortable with a thin phone. I am and it is powerful and I think a good bang for your buck.,Postif
"Amazing phone, I love it more than my husband's Galexy S9.",Postif
Best budget phone of 2018. I absolutely love it and the camera is amazing and i think gold is so pretty :D. Delivery was even earlier than expected. I would recommend this phone to anyone out there looking for a great phone but doesn't have $1000 to spend on the latest flagships.,Postif
"The most buget and amazing phone!!!
This phone has such a attractive appearance, nice screen resolution, excellent camera with this cheap price, so much better than my previous Sony XA2 Ultra which is two times more expensive.",Postif
Kinda of surprise how well built this phone was. It feels solid and screen quality is pretty good too. It feels almost as good as my Samsung Galaxy S8+.,Postif
"Fast beautiful phone. Any penny you spend is 200% worth it. So US wants to block this phone and some people just leave bad comments even they don't have the phone in handy. Good performance (not excellent coz its not 1000$$$ iPhone X). If you scared the company spies you, ask Facebook 1st.",Postif
For the price I paid for the phone it's a lot better than iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 8. When you hold the phone you can feel the excellent quality of the phone. The 64GB memory really helps a lot. Overall very happy to purchase the phone.,Postif
"I added a wireless charging receiver that I bought on Amazon for $7-$8 and used the clear jelly case that came with the phone. Now I can charge it in my car or at home without wires.
The calls are clear, the camera(s) are great and battery life is long.
The fingerprint reader works better than I expected. I had a Samsung s6 before and this is many times faster.
A large screen was one of my requirements, so that I wouldn't have to put on reading glasses. This is just right for me.
A couple days after turning the phone on, it downloaded and installed Android 8.0 (Oreo).
I highly recommend this phone.",Postif
"Great phone, great features, and a great price. Had an LG G3 before so its a major upgrade compared to that older phone.

AT&T store had nothing in stock that was close to what this give you for the price.",Postif
"Excellent picture quality! So far, the phone is working great. I only had it for a couple of days.",Postif
"Awesome phone! I have had iPhones and HTC prior to owning this Huawei, and I could definitely say that this phone is comparable to those big company / popular phones (if not better)! You have to see it and experience it yourself. Such an underrated phone with such a great price!!!",Postif
Dont waste ur money for expensive phones.. I GOT huawei mate se for myself and my wife and we are very happy!! Good quality phone vey nice picures works perfect with metro pcs.. Very recommended!,Postif
"Excellent phone. Not just an excellent phone for the money. I'm sure there are better phones out there (pen, speaker, camera, usb-c, etc). But there is not a phone with a zeiss lense or speakers that are $800 better or more than these. As a matter of fact, since I buy for quality and value, there's not a phone on the market that is $800 or more better than this one.",Postif
Nice phone good quality great price just wish the screen was better quality like Samsung,Postif
"This phone is the best kept secret in the industry,",Postif
I bought it for my son and liked so much it will be my Samsung's replacement,Postif
"This phone met my expectations. Works fast and smooth. Definitely a good value for the money
Very nice phone.",Postif
"I love the phone, easy to setup, good camera, long battery life, fast response, nice user experience, ... much better than $400+ other phones.",Postif
"An amazing phone, writing the review from it now! The pictures look high quality and the phone handles everything smoothly. The sound is okay I wish it was louder but I still like it!",Postif
"I just got this phone week before last on Friday night. It works like a charm. If I were to accidentally broke this phone or lose it, God forbade I would buy it over again. It is very much worth it. Glad I made the decision to buy it.",Postif
"Listen, this phone is WORTH IT! Fast, elegant, quality, just to name a few... I have had it only about 3 weeks, and absolutely love it. It's right up there with the big hitters like Galaxy 9, and I phone.",Postif
"I upgraded from an HTC Desire 626s to try and find a well-performing up-to-date phone on a budget. This phone has met all my expectations so far. Great amount of storage, great performance, highly recommended.",Postif
ok,Postif
"This phone has worked incredibly well. The operating system and processor are fast, and it has a lot of memory.",Postif
"Battery is a tad weak and ii would be better with ""5"" WiFi. For the money though, it stands alone.",Postif
"Great Budget phone!
Pros: Long Battery Life, great look and huge screen.
Cons: No fast charge, Camera has some grainy pictures.",Postif
"Holy crap!!!! The battery life on this baby is amazing.
Normally listening and streaming music on my work shift will take my battery from 100% down to around 20%. With this device, the same 9 hour shift, I walk out of work with just under 80%. Loving this phone.",Postif
Great phone! Everything about it works as well or better than the flagship OnePlus 3 phone I bought two years ago at twice the price.,Postif
"Strong build . Average sound volume, decent picture quality... recommend as a good budget phone .. video buffering and camera are ok.. giving 4 stars since volume is just ok",Postif
"This has been one of the best Android phones I've ever owned. I've had minor issues with Bluetooth audio stuttering, but other than that this phone is just as good as the high-end flagship devices from Samsung, LG, or Motorola.",Postif
Bought this phone to replace my Samsung Galaxy and I am impressed with the quality so much I bought another for my son. Easy to use and so much better than the Samsung. I would highly recommend this phone.,Postif
"If you are looking for a quality phone this is the one with a good price.
I am very happy with this photo and I highly recommend this photo.",Postif
"I got my old iPhone wet. Bought this to play Pokemon on my second line/account. I may abandon the cult of apple after using this phone. At the price point I thought it'd be equivalent to the tired old iPhone 6 I was replacing.... I was sorely underestimating this phone. Solid phone, fair price, and easy transition.",Postif
"Will not allow download from Google play store on standard data, only WiFi which I don't have where I live! Took forever to transfer from my other Huawei phone only to be extremely disappointed.",Negatif
"I only bought this because another brand lied about updating and they have a volume/sound bug they refused to fix. This phone is ok, it works. It's worth the money and I'd recommend it. Here's the problem and it makes the phone useless to my lifestyle. 1.) the front of the phone is curved. Glass screen protectors won't follow that curve and gunk will build up under the edge of the glass around the face of the phone. There doesn't seem to be any plastic screen protectors that would follow the curved edges 2.) There are no heavy duty cases. There are a few but they either look childish or they look like a truck tire. I had an Honor 5x and I know how delicate the screen and camera glass are but at least it had a flat screen. I can't carry the phone around unprotected, my only choice is to return it based on the reason there aren't any peripherals made to ensure my phone will last several years.",Negatif
The screen is a nice size and the graphics are great. The price is also nice too. Overall good phone.,Postif
"Second Huawei phone, very affordable and does a pretty good job.",Postif
This is a solid phone for the price excellent battery life too,Postif
I bought this phone for my grandma. And its soo slow. Restart like thousands time already still slow as hell.,Negatif
"Really happy with this phone. Works great with dual sim . I live in Costa Rica , work in US.
Pleased ??",Postif
"I love it! I have been using huwaei since long. This one is amazing! It's amazing phone at such a great price! I recommend anybody who is looking for good camera, amazing storage space and fast processor!",Postif
"I had no plans to buy this phone, it was something very last minute, and I am so happy my phone broke, which lead me to buying the Huawei Mate SE, because it is awesome",Postif
"I have two teen daughters with this phone.
They don't complain about the phone.",Postif
good,Postif
Bought this for my Mom as a new phone for Christmas. Delivery was fast and upon opening the phone box it was so nice and new. Everything worked perfect as soon as I put her SIM card in (ATT) service. The picture is so nice and for the price its a steal. Very good purchase,Postif
"For the price, it does exactly what I need to do. Bluetooth seems buggy but that's about it.",Postif
"This Hauwei Mate SE... exceeded my expectation!!! For a first time buyer, i'm in love with it!!!! I got me the gold one...bought a few cases and screen protectors which enhanced her beauty! Now i'm good to go!",Postif
"I purchased Huawei Mate SE with really big expectations after I read a lot of reviews online. But now I am returning it back to Amazon before one month is over.

I am not going to talk about the good stuff about the phone because the phone is really nice. I can say it's really a great phone with really spectacular features. It is really very much customizable, I can say it's much better than any other Android phones out there on the market as to customization perspective. But the phone has lots of downsides and I would like to inform you about these.

The most important problem I have experienced is that the phone's performance declined significantly within a month. The phone slowed down significantly. Sometimes it is responding like 1 to 2 seconds later and this is the most important problem to me. Especially when downloading something or running a few different apps it gets really sluggish. This is very annoying and the phone with these specs and strong processor should not easily be worn out like this. Warning: the processor is made by a Chinese processor company (Kirin), unlike most smartphones this phone does not have Qualcomm brand processor which could be the reason.

I also don't like the display which is not bright enough. The screen brightness is not good at all, it may be okay for the inside environments but when you're out there especially on a sunny day under the sunlight it's it's really not user-friendly even though you max the screen brightness...

Another downside of the phone is the data transfer. The reason I like Android phones because it's easy to transfer data just like plug-and-play or plug your phone into your computer and you can easily transfer data but on this machine you need to download Huawei application to your computer so that you will be able to transfer your data I have experienced that the phone keeps disconnecting during the data transfer. I lost data just because of that and I lost time...

Another reason I bought this phone was to use with my Cricket line and its hot spot but even though the phone is unlocked the hotspot service is not working with Cricket when I checked with Cricket customer service they said that they will get in touch with the manufacturer so the manufacturer will allow hotspot tethering which really sucks. This may depend on the carrier and I would highly suggest being precautious if you intend to use hotspot with this device.

I would like to throw a few words for the battery as well. I am a heavy data user and I can say Huawei Mate SE has a decent battery life. In my case, I was able to get at least 8 hours of battery life with lots of streaming and social media activities.

So like I said, I really like this phone but I'm going to return it back because it has a lot of downsides that really impacts my daily usage...",Postif
Switched from a iPhone 6 plus to this. I've been very pleased with it. No regrets.,Postif
Have been using for the past 3 weeks with no issues. Battery life is good and easily lasts a day. Camera is decent for the price. No lag so far. Great purchase for $230.,Postif
"Great budget phone that can hold its own standing next to a flagship despite lack of obvious features you might expect from a more expensive phone (lacks NFC, wireless charging & fast charging, and 5ghz WiFi). Otherwise, great phone.",Postif
"Device is slower than expected. GPS worked interminently after a couple of months and stopped working at all last week. Tilting works to slow, as does the rest of the phone. Price is very convenient, screen size is comfortable. Camera quality is worse than expected.
May be good for a little kid, but not if you use it for work",Negatif
I love this phone. Does everything I need it to.,Postif
west of money don't work after few month of money don't buy,Negatif
Fast phone. Nice battery performance. Really good choice for a limited budget.,Postif
"I like this phone Andrs islas very Nice the packs, all islas beautiful, Andrs it's working.",Postif
It's a great phone for the price really,Postif
Everything works great. No problems with operating on T-mobile network. Fast shipping and excellent value for the price.,Postif
"The cell phone is good, but two phone CARDS can't work at the same time, one card can't work all the time, so I still need to buy another phone",Postif
I am using the phone to do my review good phone can't complain good battery life,Postif
"Excellent in every aspect.
Huawei is on its way to commandeering the smart phone market. Second Huawei I've owned and the quality and performance just keeps getting better.",Postif
"Great phone. Headphones jack is iffy, only with my big headphones. My earbuds work well with the phone though. I think there's to much power needed to power certain headphones, so the phone doesn't work with the big (nice) ones. I'd buy the phone again though. Great value.",Postif
Never been upset with any Huawei products. Would buy again. Great buy since updated to Oreo update,Postif
The most competitive product among others for the same price range. It satisfies all my needs for a cell phone.,Postif
It doesn't connect to Bluetooth to well,Postif
"wow. Bought this to replace an s6. The predicted text is great. OREO. S6 fingerprint sensor stunk. This is great.
Best 250 I have spent. Saw some views saying camera is just ok. It as good ,or better, than s6. 16 mb. The volume on the headphones ( not included) is loud. Came with case, but will upgrade. Pic is great.
THIS IS A DEAL, WOULD BUY AGAIN.
CRAIG
UPDATE. I took a video. It was flawless. But there is no video editing option. That would be great. The text msg froze up twice. But I just closed the background apps. I think it was a software glitch, not the phone. The fingerprint reader works great, unlike my s6. It was lousy.
To sum this up. Still? a great phone. Oreo 8.0
Fyi. Hope this helps, Craig",Postif
"For the cost, probably the best phone you can get! Great camera, lost of memory, almost edge screen,long battery, reliable and beautiful phone!",Postif
Works very well and fast even though I have plenty of open apps. I'm very happy so far.,Postif
Love this phone. The quality of the camera could have been better but still gives you good enough take a good picture. Love the software as well which comes with a lot of features. The device is very snappy ....no hitches.,Postif
"The phone came to me perfectly fine, with the box scuffed and dirtied a bit but it was okay when I opened it. However when it came, there were no bubble wrap or even newspapers to secure the phone from moving around. Which could have potentially cracked the phone inside.",Postif
"Battery does not last long, not sure if mine is defective. I turned off almost all background apps and the battery does not last as indicated",Postif
Poor signal with straight talk,Postif
"It was all I expected it to be , wonderful phone for that price. sound is very good, good battery life last much longer than other phones I have had would recommend it to anyone who wants to purchase a phone. One of the best phones on the market . The famous I phone has to work hard to compare with it. GOOOOOOOOD phone",Postif
Product arrived as described.,Postif
"I am not satisfied with picturing, else is good",Postif
Great phone at a great price. Takes awesome photos. Good speaker sound. Great size. I love my phone.,Postif
"This is the best phone I have ever used. What a product from Hauwei. Please, if you have need of a good phone with quality performance, this is the phone for you.",Postif
I'm stoked. $237 for this? I broke my s7 edge which was truly the worse phone I've ever owned and was on a budget to replace it. I decided to change carrier to t mobile and take a chance on this bad boy and it was totally worth it.,Postif
"Is anyone having a problem on the touch screen? Its not that quick, have to press hard:(",Postif
"I love this phone. Hooked right up with my provider, quick, smooth, NO issues",Postif
"The battery last 1 and a half day. I watch movies and series, its sound is good as well. The quality of the pictures is not the best (front cam is low quality). Finally, I think that something is wrong with the software because it does not rotate properly (just when I expand the video in YouTube or Netflix)",Postif
Good phone for the price,Postif
"Phone speakers are poor quality. It is very hard to understand the other person on the phone. Sometimes the volume ranges from can bearly hear the other person talking, to can hear okeyish, still not good, but only if I push the phone hard on my ear. And no, I do not have a hearing problem.",Negatif
"Excellent phone. Great speed, camera quality and fingerprint sensor. There is nothing better for the money.",Postif
"The camera is the bomb!!!!! Any chance I get I would be taking selfie, lol. Better than my Samsung S5",Postif
"Very good Phone so far, average battery duration 2 days, good photo quality, so fast to use it is awesome.. i been using samsung galaxy s8 but this phone is similar or even better. i love it.",Postif
"great cell phone, photos are better than iPhone",Postif
I had a Honor 5x. I bought this phone to replace it. Great specs for the price of the phone.,Postif
Great durable phone,Postif
"Tldr; Great phone for the price. Do not buy for the camera, it has terrible performance!

Let's make this quick.
Pros- The phone is very snappy. Responsive and just a joy to use.
- Screen is great for the price. Feels soft for typing. Decent for videos and zoom is nice for widescreen.
- Allows you to use MOST of the stock Android apps with full support.
- Battery is quite awesome. Processor is fast and efficient.
- Mostly a stock experience after changing a few settings.

Cons- CAMERAS are excessively bad. I can't stress enough that you should buy a different phone if you want a good front and back camera. These are so poor in performance it's kinda sad. Oversaturated, poor auto focus, horrible white balance and exposure settings for auto. Even after trying to install 3rd party apps as well as Google's own camera. I came to the conclusion that the sensor is just grainy and dissapointing. My 3 year old Nexus 6p worth 4 less megapixels takes better photos just cause it uses Google's image processing.
- Huawei's ROM is pretending to be Android iOS it's pretty lame but easily fixed.

End: Glad I bought it totally going to buy one for my dad later in the year.",Postif
I didn't mind switching from my prepaid Verizon to prepaid at&t in order to use this phone. I got a cheaper bill better coverage and an awesome phone .,Postif
I've had this phone for almost a year now and it still works great. No lagging or screen malfunctions.,Postif
Bought as a gift...,Postif

Great product at a cheap price.,Postif
"Awesome phone for not a lot of money! Speedy, great screen, all day battery life. Overall a very quality phone. At this price you can buy a great midrange phone yearly and still come out ahead compared to buying the next Iphone or Samsung. My biggest gripe is the camera which struggles a bit in low light.",Postif
nice build quality,Postif
OK quicksilver ! Great running system.,Postif
Excellent,Postif
Perfect for everyday use,Postif
"It's a great phone, no complaining.",Postif
Love it.,Postif
"Buen telfono inteligente, hace lo mismo que hacen otros de su gama con menos de la mitad del dinero. Buena compra!",Postif
Not a bad phone at all. Battery does charge a bit slow for my liking and my headphone was missing but all in all a good device.,Postif
I really like the phone. The price was in my wheel-house and it has the amount of memory that is perfect for me. Easy to use and set up. The more I use it the more I'm learning about the features.,Postif
"A great phone comparable to Samsung.
Excellent camera photo quality is remarkable.
I have tried Samsung S7 and S8 and have had problems with the motherboard under one year so I have invested in this Huawei and have no regrets...Value for your money and much more!",Postif
"Probably the best value phone i've ever seen. The camera is great, i love the fingerprint sensor, the display size is perfect. I'm still a bit suspicious about the whole Chinese government stalking people through huawei phones but other than that conspiracy I love this phone",Postif
The best camera easy to use and beautiful,Postif
The camera is bad without enough light and the sound is depthless,Postif
For what you get with this phone it is an amazing price! Just watch the color selection as I ordered the grey before I realized that the exact same phone in gold was over $50 cheaper. I replaced my LG with this one and so far am loving Huawei!! Highly recommended!,Postif
"The phone completely new and it came with a simple case which even though if it doesn't cover that much, it helps for a few days in order to get another case. Everything else in new shape conditions. Great phone for a low price compared to other phones in the market.",Postif
Best budget phone of 2018 can't wait to see was huawei have in store for 2019,Postif

Just what I needed.,Postif
"Had this a few months now and very happy with it. It updated to Android 8. The camera works good enough. Finger print reader very fast. So glad that Motorola did not offer their 64 gig g6 in the USA. Got this instead and for the money, an excellent phone.",Postif
This phone is amazing. Battery life is exceptional. One can add apps and they don't slow the phone down. The price is good as well for a phone that ordinarily would cost a lot more.,Postif
Nice phone with plenty of features.,Postif
"A little aggravating at times to navigate compared to Galaxy s6 I had but for the price its tough to complain about. Its probably my phat fingers and the way I am always rushing things anyway.. LOL Pretty damn good phone for the money, I can tell you that",Postif
"Super fast, two cameras and latest operating system for 200+ dollars only. Best budget phone I can find in the market!",Postif
Great phone! it will be best to have better screen solution!,Postif
Huawei did it again,Postif
"One of the best from Huawei. Fingerprint the best and the fastest I've seen all this years. The phone itself is super fast, above standard camera, long lasting battery, smooth operating system, just name it. For the price? Go for it without a doubt.",Postif
"Nice responsive phone, but I returned it. I am accustomed to plain android on nexus type devices. The EMUI interface feels old and clunky",Postif
"Decided to get the white/gold version after much research and am VERY satisfied with the purchase. Absolutely gorgeous phone at a bargain price for its specs. Functioning seamlessly so far, even comes with a clear TPU case.",Postif
What I like about this phone is that it's great style and quality for a affordable price. My only complaints which are minor is the screen sharpness could be a tad better and the phone likes to heat up a bit under heavy use.,Postif
"Big screen, excellent performance, easy to use, cheap but looks expensive.",Postif
"Initially, I had concern whether it is really unlocked or not. My sim card is T mobile and with LTE network it works excellent. Excellent image quality. Excellent design. I got it on time with all accessories. I recommend it to others as well.",Postif
I love this phone for the price,Postif
Has so many features and extremely responsive. It has also face recognition and allows some of the social media apps to connect with 2 accounts at the same time which is an excellent feature if you have more than one account like me.,Postif
I don't like the low volume and vibration intensity.,Postif
"The only thing I don't like very much of this phone is the camera, I believe that's because I was used to the camera of the p9, this phone is perfect, it runs smoothly, the display is very good, you pay less than what you get",Postif
Haven't had any problem. Love the size and it's a great phone for the price.,Postif
Great phone...camera is okay,Postif
"Over all this product is amazing, great camera quality, nice overall look, ex. But I have to give a warning to customers who want to buy this phone and use it through the network of verizon, verizon unfortunately does not work with this phone.",Postif
", best phone of all time now I'm Huawei for life",Postif

"I didn't know what to buy LG Stylo 4 or this one, good that I pick Hauwei mate se more ram and storage",Postif

Best parts: Blazing performance, beautiful screen, camera, headphone jack and battery life.
Worst parts: Micro USB.
Overall: Strongly recommend.",Postif
"Good product but not tested/support for Fitbit watches.
Night mode photos capture is not good.
Good process speed,build quality is good
I tested internet speed b/w I phone XR vs Mate se....both will perform at same speed...",Postif
"Can't ask for more with this phone, looks great and is well built. So far had it for 3 months and no complaints. This phone can challenge Samsung for its build quality.",Postif
This is a great phone bought it to replace my S8 plus and it delivered very powerful budget phone packed with lots of specs it takes awesome pics as well,Postif
Bluetooth hell. It's a battle to get it to pair I had to fight to get it to pair with my car,Negatif

Fantastic product for the price!,Postif
Good phone. I like it. It makes amazing photos and video.,Postif
Works great so far,Postif
"I used the phone more than a week. The screen is pretty and big. But when I open my Facebook for updates,sometimes I flicker back. Playing games is not very satisfactory",Negatif
"I was in the market for a mid-range phone, I typically don't invest in expensive flagship phones as being in the construction industry, the more expensive the phone, the faster it seems to break, I had a ZTE grand x4 for roughly the past year and a half, and while it did everything I needed it too, I was just wanting something a little more and a little newer with more storage, I was looking at the xiaomi mi a1, but it didn't appear I would get lte wit at&t, and was also looking at the Motorola g5, but seen a g6 was about to be released and didn't want to wait, so I saw this phone while looking at unlocked phones at Best buy, but they didn't have any in stock so I ordered it from Amazon, and it was 20.00 cheaper. So far it's a great phone, and my only complaint is no USB C and fast charge, something my 70.00 ZTE had. I ordered a magnetic charge cable that should arrive tomorrow and that will hopefully take care of my dislike for micro USB. Lol. But the phone feels quality, the camera is decent, and the screen is beautiful, and has some neat features. I would definitely purchase again.",Postif
"I just love this cellphone, pictures are stunning. I don't have to charge it very often and when I do, it charge super fast. Not complaints at all. Love it!",Postif
Wife loves it so far. Great camera and battery life.,Postif
Handles everyday test very well most games I throw at it surprisingly smooth unit rarely seems to be hot under heavy use. An awesome mid-level phone that 90% of the users would be more than satisfied with.,Postif
Great for the price my husband is very happy,Postif
I like this phone and would buy it again.,Postif
Only two cons : The camera is not good and the battery is average. The rest nothing to complaint. The screen is realy nice. The phone is fast with a good finger sensor.,Postif
This phone truly has 4 G networking..... not like xiaomi A1 only got 3 G,Postif
Great product,Postif

This product is like buying a Samsung Galaxy phone,Postif
"Great phone for a good price , I am amazed at the different features the phone offers. Wonderful!",Postif
my previous was a Huawei. I like the upgrades. but other had a bigger screen,Postif
"This would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for very important flaw. That flaw is that I sometimes my phone doesn't receive calls or when I call others that they don't get the call. So I have to sometimes use WhatsApp for calling others to make sure they get the call of they don't answer using TMobile or have others call me using Whatsapp if I don't pick up to make sure my phone rings. This is the same problem I had with my Huawei Honour Phone. I called TMobile and they were saying Huawei phones sometimes doesn't work on their network. I love the phone for watching videos, surfing web, etc. This phone is one of th best values with it's specs for phones at least a $100 more... hopefully some update fixes this problem.",Postif
Phone suits my needs perfect. I love the price.,Postif
Dollar for dollar the best phone imaginable. Camera and speaker are just ok but everything else is terrific.,Postif
"I haven't seen anyone mention this but aside the excellent performance and how beautiful the screen is, the touch response is what really make this phone shine in my opinion. It makes general navigating and typing a joy as each touches are registered instantly when your finger makes contact to the screen. Although the speakers can use a little bit for the improvements, this is a BEAST of a phone at this price.",Postif
Excellent...Quality...Great Price!,Postif
I will never get stuck in a contract again this phone blows away anything I've ever had including my Samsung S8,Postif
"I like the phone a lot! It's my first high quality phone that I have been able to get, and I am glad I did! It handles Pubg well and I have a bunch of games on the phone and hasn't slowed down at all!",Postif
I wasn't expecting much as I've received some pretty bad electronics before AT&T this phone is great,Postif
Nice but not worth price.. Better choices around,Postif

"Great phone, everything you need and nothing you don't. Works without issue I'm very happy with it.",Postif
Amazing phone!. Absolutely love it. The warranty I ordered for it never showed up though and it was very expensive so stay away from that.,Postif
"I don't like the front camera, it makes me lighter and it's a little blurry, the back camera is fine",Postif
"La verdad que el rendimiento del equipo no es el esperado, no soporta wifi 5ghz el comportamiento de la cmara es bastante irregular, por este precio hay muchas mejores opciones",Negatif

"Great device, solid feel in hand. No cheap plastic here. Highly recommend this phone. You can't beat the price",Postif

"Got this phone just before vocation to Honolulu, it took better pictures than my wife's iPhone, which is 3 times more expensive.

"This is the best phone I've ever had. Been through iPhones, Galaxy, BlackBerry. This one tops it.",Postif
"Laugh in Samsung's face! Great phone, decent price",Postif
Very good phone.. happy with it so far although sometimes it blocks a little when I open certain apps quickly but overall it's an excellent price value,Postif
"Every function very good, compatible with my existing Samsung note.
Only thing not happy with is only have 2.4G wifi no 5G, not that important.",Postif
I was doubtful about the company before buying the phone. But now that I have used it for 2 months I think this is one of the best phones out in the market in the price range.,Postif
Better than iPhone,Postif
I really like the performance and build quality of the phone. My highlight is the reduced-bezel display.,Postif
Amazing price. It beats all other brands.,Postif
"Maybe I'm not lucky got the wrong one, Problem with my issue is while surfing the web, 4 or 5 minutes will get screen freeze, then it auto restart. same as i open some apps will have the same problem. 4/GB RAM, 64GB storage sound good, with dual lens. $229. I like the price, I like Dual cameral. but something is wrong with the phone, also the fingerprint, seems useless because it still asks your password,",Postif
Does its job very well. My daughter loves it,Postif
"Great phone. Amazing price for the amount of storage. Fast speed and big screen.
Just can't seem to find any decent screen protectors that will fit right, but I'm sure it's just because it's so new.",Postif

"I am a US T-Mobile customer and my last 2 phones were:

- Oneplus 1 for 2yrs
- Oneplus 3 for almost another 2yrs.

Both were purchased directly from the Oneplus website, not Amazon. I loved them both. After recently breaking my OP3 I was was devastated to find out that my insurance was not able to provide a replacement phone only a refund, which sounded ok at first (I would just find one here on Amazon). Since I could not afford the price of the new OP6 (just released), I re-purchased a new OP3 from a seller here on Amazon. To my dismay it was an international version and could only receive 2G speeds from my carrier due to the Band range. So after returning it, I found this gem for $150 less than my OP3.

For the last 4 years I have enjoyed the use of phones that were on the pricier side and manufactured by a startup company based out of China. I did my research and Huawei appears to be making phones with great parts for low prices. The total price I paid for this phone was almost $270 total with tax. That is a lot of money to spend when bigger companies like LG and Samsung have nice phones for $200, but their quality is not quite as good Overall (Screen resolution, camera quality, internal storage and RAM that the Mate SE has for $250).

I would recommend this phone for US GSM customers that are comfortable with paying $250 for a $400 phone. With all that said, this phone has a solid build, great specs, and a happy customer.",Postif
A great phone with affordable price.,Postif

It is definitely worth the $220 that I spent on it.,Postif
Excelent product for the price. Battery long last full day with noraml use.,Postif
Great phone for the price range and beats most phones that are over $500+ . Highly would recommend.,Postif
Great phone.Owned 5x 6x and now the mate. Don't listen to hype this phone is not a budget phone. The extremely few places that this phone has had corners cut on are no different from any brand of phone. The 7x did have major software issues but the mate see fixes those and adds a little extra oomph to the deal. No matter what two phones you compare ones not going to add up to the other somewhere. But Huawei has offered a phone three times it's value with a fair price tag.,Postif
I am happy with my purchase. Great battery life. Lots of features that I am still discovering.,Postif

"This is good phone but I'm sure you might like the essential phone more. The camera is ok but not as great as product reviews make it seem. Zoom sucks, low light photos suck.
But I think I could forgive all that if the phone was actually gold like I ordered.
The ""gold"" color is actually rose gold. Very obvious pink hue. Had I known I would've just got the silver one.
The ui is really nice tho. The phone is super smooth. Just an FYI the lockscreen wallpaper cannot be changed which is kind of a bummer",Postif
Only drawback is it doesnt come with headphones,Postif
I like it!!,Postif

"This is a beautiful phone. There is no need to pay the outrageous prices for the tier one phones. The Huawei Mate SE Is a great phone for most of us. Yes, the expensive phones have features that the 2 to 3 dollar phones don't, but not enough to make 7 to 8 dollars difference. I am very happy with this phone. Very fast, nice size screen. All the bells and whistles I need. Would recommend it to the average user, which most smart phone users are.",Postif
"I like this phone a lot. I've had it for less than one week. My previous phone was a google / motorola nexus 6.

Good:
Screen is very nice and bright
Battery life is incredible. will last me two days when my old phone needed charging during each day
Camera is amazing. Front camera is as good as my old phone's back camera
Comes with a nice clear case

Bad:
Touch sensor is not great and sometimes registers a tap as a swipe. I wonder if this is a software or hardware problem
Form factor -- 2:1 aspect ratio is weird and unusual for android. There's a special button to tell the system to stretch the screen for each app. It has worked in every app I've pressed it, but it seems weird. It's also hard for me to reach the whole screen with one hand.
Spyware is factory installed.

I usually like to mod my phone and get root and install custom roms. This phone I haven't even rooted yet, but I still leave that open as a possibility. The built in ROM is quite nice it supports themes including dark mode. I've been using DNS66 to block ads. It works ok, but some sites still show ads. This phone doesn't have a section in XDA yet but the previous model (Honor 7x) does and the development is progressing slowly. This phone is bootloader unlock able and root able using the same procedure as the 7x. Today Huawei released Oreo beta for honor 7x in US and I assume that will come to this phone too.

Overall I'm quite happy with this device and I think that it's pretty good. I hope that Huawei / Hi Silicon release information about the CPU and camera allowing custom kernel and ROM development.",Postif
"This Huawei Mate SE is much nicer and more sophisticated than the Honor 5X. The problem I have for both phone is the operating system taking too much space. The Mate SE Firmware used 12 Gigabyte plus 3 GB for other when it was just shipped. After the 1st software update, it still used 8 GB plus. My Honor 5x is the same way. It has 16 GB and the Firmware used almost 6 GB plus 2 GB for other. I keep having clean up files and delete photo in order to keep my honor 5X running. I am having doubt about how the operating system used up that much space (8 GB plus 3 GB for other?). I am not sure if other brand are the same way.",Postif
"Edit: This is legitimately the worst purchase I have ever made in my life. 3 months after arrival the phone is completely unusable, as it fails to recognize sim cards. It is completely irrelevant how good the warranty is, how the company treats customers, and everything else. If your product is completely nonfunctional in 3 months you need to do the world a service and get out of the market..

Beware. Even in protective cases expect this phone to last a month before the screen breaks. I dropped it 10"" while in the case to have the screen shatter. After sending it to Square trade, and having it come back as good as new, it immediately went back into the case, and has developed a new crack in the screen, without being dropped at all. This in the month since it was returned to me. All in all a beer average device by performance, but Jesus it's more fragile than a soap bubble.",Negatif
Best phone for money,Postif
Great phone,Postif
Nice new phone and fast delivery. Thanks...,Postif
Great phone for this price,Postif
Amazing phone,Postif
"I am liking this phone so far. It was easy to setup and has most of the features I need. Since it is unlocked, I was able to use my existing nano sim The WiFi is limited to 2.4 but I knew that ahead of time. I imagine this is why the phone stays cool and has a decent battery life. The phone is light but has a large screen. I love the fingerprint scanner as it allows me to setup multiple fingerprints to unlock the phone. Very pleased so far. Sound is decent but not loud enough. Let's hope it lasts 2 years. If it does, I will have gotten my money's worth!",Postif
Best phone,Postif

"battery is great. Sorry Huawei won't do NA promotion anymore since Trump's trade war. Very great product for the price, That's perfect transition while we are waiting for wireless 5G available in 2019. Don't buy any expensive phone now since 5G will be a big deal. no phone is going to support it since the technology is still in developing stage not finalized yet. China has tested 5 G wireless, download speed is up to 10 Gbps. one HD movie download will take less than a second.",Postif
Like,Postif
exactly as described,Postif
Really good. OVERALL,Postif
"For this price, this phone can not be beaten. I'm done buying $800-$1000 phones. Budget and mid range phone have closed the gap considerably in the last year or two. This phone is fast, the fingerprint sensor is insanely fast and accurate, storage and RAM are crazy good for this price. And it's unlocked so you're not tied to a carrier. Can't say enough good things about this phone.",Postif
"Was very nervous about ordering this product, yet brand is very popular in Russian Federation and many other Russian speaking countries. Phone has great battery life, very common features, and is easy in setting up. Slightly heavy in weight, but comfortable to hold in a hand. Comes with clear semi-soft case. Back and front camera and video is amazing quality. If I would know before about this brand, I would never spend crazy money on other lg/Samsung/blackberry phones. Extremely pleased with product.",Postif
Great so great !!!!!,Postif
"Adobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.
Install Flash Player
Comparing to the spec(4GBs ram, 64 ROM), this phone is so cheap.
I used it for 5 days now.
It is still smooth.

The camera quality is 8/10
I like HDR mode in this phone.
You won't regret to get it.",Postif
The phone seemed pretty nice at first but now when I try to make a call I get a popup saying I need to enable VoLTE to make calls. There is no option to do that so now I have an essentially worthless phone. I can't find any tech support regarding this issue.,Negatif
Good overall phone with one giant negative. This phone will not connect to Wi-Fi 5g. This is a big deal as the 2.4 band is loaded and makes your internet slow and will not stream without buffering.,Negatif
"I went from a note 3 to this and felt like it was a downgrade.
Pros:
Price
Touch sensor

Cons:
touch screen does not seem as responsive as my note 3.
Camera only shoots great under perfect lighting.
Speaker is sub par",Postif
"Phone works fine. I enjoyed using it for gaming and daily usage although, screen is not bright enough. Speaker was loud but at high volume it explodes. However, after 2 weeks of usage the speaker started having problems such as: staticky, and when put on high volume it explodes and after observing it the speaker started weakening and i couldn't barely cant hear anything. I called Huawei support team/warranty department and it was hard communicating with them since they are based in china. They told to me to factory reset my phone every time the speaker stops working. After factory resetting it worked but who would buy a phone that needs to be factory reseted every time something goes wrong with it? . Don't get me wrong the phone is nice and performance is fine. Speaker problems though is a big ""NO, NO"".",Negatif
"It's affordable, it's fast, it has a great camera for the price, and the screen is big and easy to read. I've had zero problems with this phone, and only a couple of small caveats that led to not quite making that fifth star. One is a lack of support for 5ghz wifi (a major oversight for a device released in 2018), and the other is that Huawei has discontinued their bootloader unlocking service. They didn't just discontinue it, they lied about when they were ending the service, having announced an end date.. the week after they took down the site. So, if you were hoping to play with custom roms, this is not the phone for you.
Beyond that, it's performed like a champ, and still manages to make it through a day with decent charge, and in my use case, with the murderously battery-draining apps I need to keep loaded on it for my job, that is really saying something. My previous phone, a Blu R1 HD, was at 20% by 6pm, this baby is reporting in with 55% at 10pm.. There's also no dreaded sudden yet silent loss of connectivity requiring a reboot on a daily basis that's so common with chinese phones, either. It's perfectly reasonable to expect 10 days or more of rock solid up time.",Postif
"I've used several budget phones. This one was a disappointment. It was slow, logging, poor camera, issue with convertering photos to MMS massage etc.",Negatif
This thing is absolutely nuts for the money. Fast no lag and everything I use runs fine on it. The HiSuite software that you can download for it allows you to text from the PC while it is connected. You can also easily backup all your stuff using the software even import export your texts etc. I can't get over how much you get for the money. This thing even runs super cool even with the bulkiest case available for it. I used this thing all day without a charger and only used 9% battery too and that included watching some videos on youtube and everything. This is one smokin phone and definitely holds it's own against current flagship models out there.,Postif
"Great design, remarkable battery life, nice screen, friendly OS, also came with a transparent cover.
Now the bad one: the camera . Specially in low light conditions, blurry, difficult to get a right focus and for sure noisy pics. At the day light you take maybe a little pale images, like washed colors, when you zoom in, the sharpness it's not that good . Have a manual mode in order to take the manual control over the pics, but really, who have time to set all that taking a casual pic? Others phones do this job with great results instead this one.
It's a sad point to this device",Postif
"Although it is dual SIM phone, one of the SIM didn't have service. Either of the SIMs worked individually but not together. Reset the phone twice, but couldn't make it work. Otherwise phone is okay.",Negatif
"I love this brand but they seem to have the same software issue for most the phones, before this phone I had the Nova. Certain earphones don't seem to register unless used with an extender, and me, I use my earphones every single day for work so it's just too annoying for me. I have looked online for a solution and there are other people with same issue but no solve. Overall this phone is great, but just for the earphone jack issue, I am returning and purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S8 instead.",Postif
"I was so excited for this phone after doing through research for hours.
Set up was very easy, everything looked great...Until I opened the camera on Snapchat. I was in a lit, indoor environment, and the picture quality was grainy and low quality. The actual camera wasn't an improvement from the one on the app. This goes for front and rear camera. It was like I was transported to 2010 with the awful quality.
This low quality camera is a total deal breaker.",Negatif
Nice phone! Update....now has Android 8.0 update... awesome!,Postif
"Initial Review: Huawei Mate SE looks, feels and performs very good. I like it very much. It is worth more than the price I paid for it. I will chose it anytime over the other expensive phones.",Postif
"This phone is great. A lot better than most Samsung or Apple phones that cost 400+ dollars. It runs very smoothly. The camera quality is amazing. Although it does take a long time for it to fully charge (it takes about 2-3 hours for it to fully charge from 10 percent), the battery lasts very long.",Postif
Love this phone have to return it because my bluetooth wasn't connecting,Postif
Just received this phone last week b/c my other Honor phone had issues and now I can't believe I'm saying this but my phone just blew up sitting here at my desk at work. SHOCKED is beyond what I'm feeling. I have faith in this company and love the Huawei phones but idk... I'm a little hesitant now.,Negatif
Great phone so far!,Postif
"What an amazing phone for the money. I've seen a number of reviews saying it's a great phone within it's price range, but it's great phone regardless of price point. I've had high dollar, big name phones, and I like this phone better than any of them. Very impressive and we'll thought out phone.",Postif
"I phone, i was a Samsung s7 user and this phone is just as good (or verter) at a lower priceo, super fast, great display, i use a lot of apps and the phone keeps running fast and smooth, good camera with fun features. I really recommend this phone",Postif
"So far so good. Camera, at least during dat time is excellent. The buttons at bottom are a little small. works fine with my TMobile.",Postif
"Liked it, but couldn't use it in Japan, at least not with my tele company.",Postif
Amazing phone with excellent performance for the price.,Postif
Nice phone. But no headphone,Postif
"I am a bit frustrated with the imposibility of using any bluetooth device to play de fm radio. Even though i use a cable as antenna, when you try to reproduce it via bluetooth either in headsets or external speakers...you cant. A shame.",Postif
"Why spend $800-$1,000!!!!! This it's absolutely speechless, the best performance, the battery awesome, and the camera it's just out of this world. Highly recommend. And don't make the huge mistake of spending lots of $$$$ in supposedly a high end phone while this phone will save you hundreds.",Postif
Hands down the best phone under $300. Mind you this phone is very comparable to iPhone 8. Def worth the buy.,Postif
"It seems to be built well (good screen), however it is underpowered lacks a gyro scope, aptx and 5gz wifi.",Negatif
Huawei Rocks!!!,Postif
The best phone you can buy for $200 bucks! It performs like my s7.,Postif
"Been using it about a week. I will update my review if anything changes.
UPDATE 4/14/18: So something else I don't like is the brightness problem. Regardless of whether you turn on/off the auto brightness, certain apps will dim when used. So my home background and google search or some other apps are all bright but when I open my chrome browser, it gets very dimmed. Only way is to up the brightness to full but that also means everytime I come back to other apps or home background, its so bright. After using EMUI for about a week right now, I find more errors than more convenience. This dimming problem and not getting gmail notification are really starting to get on my nerves. So I had to take one more star away.

I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a good phone under the budget. Everything runs smoothly and camera is actually better than I expected and overall, I can't really complain much because of its great price. However, as someone who has to stay on top of my emails and such for my work, it gets frustrating because getting a notification for my gmails is hit or miss. I also don't get notifications from certain apps but I don't care as much as I care for my emails. I tried looking for battery optimization setting and trying to see if I can excempt it from battery saving etc but no option such as protected apps on this system. Notification is a big, big problem for me and probably lot of people who depend on their phone for work. Other than that, I don't have anything that I dislike about this phone as of yet.",Postif
"This is the best phone for the price that I've ever had. It seems like flagship quality, for $230.",Postif
"I have owned this phone a little over a week and can't say anything but good about it. Runs smooth like a champ. All apps are quick and snappy, including games and social media. 64 gb storage and the extra money for 1 extra gig of ram and double the storage was worth it to me. 4 gig ram also allows apps to run quick and even when multiple are running its quite fast. 4g lte is also a great bonus, although it's expected in most smartphones these days.
Battery life is also very good with its close to 3400 mAh battery. I can be on it all day and still have about 30% by the end of the day, given I would run it for 8 to 10 hours straight. The phone is larger than other phones I have owned and some may feel that the screen ratio is strange. I however don't mind it being a bit taller and slender. Some people are worried that because it's not a flagship phone that it won't perform and that is not the case. Fingerprint scanner is very fast and responsive. The camera is mediocre to say the least but what can you expect from a phone that doesn't break the bank at only $229 dollars. Also, for those who are worried about ""spying"", Huawei is just a company trying to make money like any other. I highly recommend this phone to any who were on the edge about purchasing in the beginning as I was. It is a fantastic product.",Postif

"Do not buy this phone if you need the dual SIM functionality - it doesn't work. With two SIM cards in the slots, only one SIM can be active at any time. The other SIM will be inactive (no signal) and cannot receive calls or messages. I spent an hour talking to Huawei tech support and they confirmed this is the case. You will need to manually go to settings to select the SIM card that you want to make active. This makes the dual sim feature practically useless. Very misleading advertising.",Negatif

Bought 2 of these phones and my one phone has had terrible speaker quality from both speakers since the beginning. Now I can barely hear anything from the earpiece speaker.

Mybhusband doesnt like that it cannot set the sleep time. It only keeps it about 10 seconds then the screen dims. We would send it back but we've had to send several items back to Amazon and it's such a hassle for us. If he always keeps his finger there the screen won't dim otherwise it's a good phone.,Postif
My phone flexed in my front pocket and the screen cracked. The honor 5x had a more robust screen . Also. My headphone jack doesn't recognize when it's plugged in. I really want to LOVE this phone. But these two unfortunate circumstances make me regret my decision,Postif
"cons:
-no WiFi calling ( thats a huge one for me since i live in an area with bad cell signal
- USB is whack (it isn't a type c USB)

Everything else on the phone is great but the first point is really a deal breaker for me so there you have it",Negatif

"No android auto compatibility, kind of a bummer for an android phone.The online support is extremely talented at telling you it will work with the next update, going on a year brand wide. You may not need android auto, but just know they don't have your back if something else happens. Bluetooth gets spotty beyond 20 inches. The phone looks really good.",Negatif
"I ordered two, one for my wife and me.
I like the stock like UI and experience of android and hence NOVA launcher is the way to go for me.
But with NOVA launcher going I am facing software bugs, I am not sure if this is because of the nova launcher or a bug within the Huawei version of the android.
When I place a call, for half of the time, I get a message saying 'Call not sent' while the call is already in progress and connected to the network.
The lock screen sometime shows and sometimes doesn't show the global clocks, its a hit n miss
The Huawei weather widget won't show in the list of widgets, it might only be working with the Huawei skin, but still...

I believe the root cause might be a bad integration of NOVA laucher with the Huawei skinned android version or Huawei's reservations with people using launchers in their phones. They do have a warning which warns you about instability of phone with 3rd party launchers.

But then I don't think that's how an android phone should be.",Postif
"Beautiful phone and you'll think you have the best hardware/software for the price. THERE IS A REASON FOR THE LOW PRICE. I am pretty sure HUAWEY is aware of this phone's issues and that's why they have other products with similar hardware/software, like the HUAWEY mate 10 pro, at $579. This phone is defective and has very serious signal problems. I understand it uses the same antenna for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. You can use only one at a time, you won't know it but you will realize it because of the miserable speed when using Bluetooth. It will not connect to Wi-Fi 5G!!!! Mostly no problems with calls and messages, but video will degrade constantly and images will become completely blurred. This is above ground! I am in NYC and am used to the intermittent signal service in the Subway, as it is only available at the train stations. All my prior phones, including my last Huawei HONOR 5X, worked fine. They would pick up the signal as we approached the station, go full signal at the station and would start losing strength as you move away from the station, but you will be able to connect! This phone is really, really bad at it (horrible really!). You may be at the station already, it would show full signal and 4GTE but it will not connect, it will be frozen, it will not open any pages. Sometimes I go through four or five station before I have a response from the phone. I thought the phone was malfunctioning and got it replaced. Same issue with replacement. I sent the second back to Huawei, I don't know what they did, but phone still the same and never heard from Huawei again. If you only use this above ground for calls and messages, you will like this phone. If you need to use it for the internet or streaming, this is not what you want, and in situations similar to mine, like the subway system, this one really sucks and in case of an emergency underground, you don't want to be caught with this one. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, IT APPEARS TO BE FACTORY DEFECTIVE.",Negatif
"According to At&T representative, this phone is not compatible with At&T visual voicemail. Only standard voicemail is available. I'm happy to update this review if this problem can be addressed. Otherwise, AT&T users should definitely pass on this device.",Negatif
"Not sure how to rate this phone as i have not even unboxed it. It seems I will need to return it as no providers in my area will support it. Also, I just found out about the UK and US ""supposed"" security risks which possibly affect this phone.

I got so excited about this phone after reading all the good reviews. I was delighted to be able to get it for $219.99 on Prime Day. Now I see that this phone has stayed at that price, so I should have not have felt so rushed to order it on Prime Day.

I needed to actually order the phone and have it on hand so I could check the box sticker for the actual IMEI numbers to check with my local providers for compatibility. I am in a very rural location and sadly it appears no providers in my location can offer service for this phone.

I hate to have to return it unopened, but if providers in my area will not support it then my only other option is to send the poor little phone back. Very sad to have to do this! Oh well... I gotta do what works for me. I am glad so many other people are very happy with their new phone. All my research says it is a great one.",Postif

"I own a software company and am hard to impress--but this phone impresses me.

I really can't list one flaw with this phone. It makes great calls, both on ATT and when I connect wireless at home. It does Internet toggling beautifully well. It downloads your contacts and calendar from Google.It's very fast. The bluetooth connects easily and, for some reason, the FLAC music I have on the phone sounds much better than it did on my old S6. I use a high-speed 128 GB Samsung SDXC card and it works great (no lag-time like I've read about on other phones).It has an FM radio chip. (Not an app, but an actual FM radio chip.) And the camera is amazing.

GPS doesn't work on this phone most of the time. It fails to find current location and hence Waze or Google maps doesn't work. This seems to be a known issue. My wife and myself are using this phone for more than 6 months. We are facing serious GPS issue on this phone from the very first day. Both Kids have iPhone and we have to use their phone for navigation. We are planning to upgrade both Kids phone but we are not considering to buy this phone due to serious GPS issue. Do you have any solution to fix this known GPS issue? Can you provide help/support number who can help us? I would happily buy two more Huawei Mate SE phones if GPS can be fixed.,Negatif

"I was very happy the first couple of days, setting up and transferring everything from my Iphone 6 was easy and worked just fine.

Then I noticed that the speakers are not that great and it is a bit hard to listen to the phone calls on speaker mode. I thought, oh well.

Then I tried to install visual voicemail and there was no way, not happening. And I thought, OK, I can check the old way.

Then it disconnected from my WiFi and there is no way to reconnect it.

Then I noticed that sometimes you touch somewhere on the screen and it thinks you touched just below where you did.

The phone looked promising but it just sucks. I'm returning and getting an Iphone. I'm done exploring other options; what a pain this phone has been in less than a week.",Negatif
"Pros: nice display, mostly unobtrusive modifications to stock Android
Cons: not great battery (very fast discharge), extremely bad WiFi and mobile data antennae.

"This is my second Huawei phone in a year as I upgraded from an Honor 6x purchased this time last year. That phone was still going strong but I wanted more RAM, storage and solid unibody design. I was so impressed with the 6x after some consideration I decided Huawei ticked all the right boxes once more.

That said this is much the same phone as the 6x but with a different form factor, somewhat stronger processor, and more RAM. Improvements include build quality, more vivid display with higher contrast ratio, smoother HD video streaming, and better audio through the headphone jack. It also has face unlock. However you need to wake the phone to it's lock screen to use the feature. The finger print sensor is faster to unlock the phone, but it's still a neat feature.

Phone has no quick charging capabilities or NFC. It also appears a bit drab in grey as the grey used is...drab. If you want the phone to appear expensive and upscale choose the white and gold varient. Oh, and the camera is good in this segment with lots of features.

For what it is and priced at $200 to $250 it's one of the best choices in smartphones one can make. Sleek, solid, reliable, and modern. I am good to go with Huawei for another year. This a great basic use phone.",Postif
Does not go good for services.,Postif
Second sim card will not work with at&t! Will only work with a 2g network,Negatif
Order arrived when promised and it's actually a really good phone. BUT just incase it is important (it is for me especially since Cricket only allows 8mbps download cap) That would be okay but that is only with LTE PHONES! This is a 4g phone and therefore it is only capable of spitting out 4 mbps downloads. It really sucks cuz other then that love this phone.,Postif
"I've had the phone for approximately 6 months and I love it aside from the picture quality in low light. My big concern is that the US government has big issues with Huawei and it's alleged spying issues. There may be a time in the future where it will be difficult to get technical support or repair work done if Huawei offices are not in the USA.
You may wish to consider purchasing a different brand of phone. Which is a shame because the phone is really good.",Postif
"Phone looks good. Its screen, view all are ok but if it is not sent from China. There are not any google services including play store too. So it suddenly looses its functionality. Chinese all over the place through the phone menus settings etc. Also there were problems related to screen sensors, i.e. the phone wasn't working properly as expected. I dont know how people place 5 to this seller, but it doesn't seem as an honest seller to me.",Negatif
"So I've owned iPhones and Galaxy's, and after paying a third of the price for this phone I truly believe Huawei is the best of both worlds! The camera is better than the iPhone, it has portrait if you're into that, also the Kirin processer is extremely smooth, almost ""Apple smooth"". This is the best Android I've owned, and I will never buy a Galaxy again. If you love the iPhone but want to try Android, you will absolutely love this device. The battery last forever and it's basically an iPhone trapped in an Android body. So before you buy a 800$ phone, consider this phone. Also if you are worried about Huawei spying, I'm just gonna put this out there, I have personally had 2 iPhone 7 phones hacked remotely And a Galaxy 7 hacked so...I don't trust any manufacturer anymore. And almost all phones are made in China, so if any of the other manufacturs wanted to spy they could, if they aren't already.",Postif
I have had this phone for a few weeks. I am extremely impressed. I got tired of having a samsung with at&t where they would release updates to slow it down. This phone does not have that and its well priced. I am very impressed. The battery life is amazing i used it all day 13+ hours and im still at 80% My usage includes social media connections to stock widgets and tickers. multiple long phone calls. connections to my home security system. The phone is fast and runs well. Only cons i have are that there are no available methods to root it or unlock the bootloader and how there isnt 5g on wifi. Other than that fantastic phone!,Postif
"Got this phone in early 2018 because I had issues after only a year and a half with my Nexus 5X and didn't want to throw several hundred dollars at a phone. Excited based on the reviews to try this one. First few months were great. Somewhere around July 2018 a software update totally ruined this phone. The GPS accuracy went to crap and my navigation apps were basically unusable (Google Maps and Waze). It's now December and not fixed. Also, my Fitbit Alta HR can't sync with this phone anymore; it's not on Fitbit's compatible equipment list but it did work when I first got the phone.",Negatif
"Warning: President Trump has banned the purchase of this brand of Chinese phone by the military due to the fact that it was determined that China steals the data that is on the phone. So, if you do online banking via this phone, Chinese data collectors will have your password, etc., to drain your bank account. Secondarily, anything made in China is intentionally made not to last much less to any standards of quality. Avoid at all costs. Personally, any electronic device that contains personal identifiers and passwords that is made in China should not be purchased for safety's sake.",Negatif
"First I need 3.5 mm phone jack, finger-print, and 6 inches screen. Purchased the honor 7x AL10/TL10 version before but not support the T-Mobile LTE; Mate 10 pro doesn't have gold color; the L24 version of honor 7x has only 32GB/3GB; this phone (L34 version) has same spec as honor 7x with T-Mobile LTE bands and 4GB RAM. Only complaint is that 64GB is still not enough; would like to pay more for 128GB.

More thoughts: the second SIM card has 2G (phone call & message) only; if you have AT&T SIM (2G shutdown), got to set it to main SIM, otherwise no service; all calls and messages have a label of SIM 1 or 2; the clone function makes it very easy to transfer app and data from other phone within same WiFi network by scanning the QR code.",Postif
the camera was a joke! ive had lower megapixels that worked better... the dual camera was not really dual... if you covered one of them it did nothing just one of them was working. deff a deal breaker for a nearly $300 phone returned if the day I received it! maybe it was just defective but ill not try again on this brand.,Negatif
"I've had this phone for a few days now. Pros are as everyone else has mentioned. Typing is so fluid and switching between apps and overall processing speed of the phone is incomparable. I replaced a Galaxy Note 5 with this phone, so the improved battery life and increased fluidity is definitely recognizable.

Some issues I have are minor, but I think they're important to know because they are things I will be looking for in a future phone, due to the absence in this one.

1. No quick charging, but I knew this when I bought the phone, just didn't realize how much I valued it due to my high daily usage. To be honest it's not necessary due to this phone's long battery life, but still a nice feature to offer.

2. Lack of tempered glass screen protectors. You will get frustrated trying to find one because for some reason this model isn't popular enough. A lot of cases though.

3. Notifications not expandable on lockscreen. Some may feel this is hit or miss, but I really miss being able to quickly reply or check a full notification on my home screen. I messaged Huawei, they said this won't be capable on this phone at all.

4. No wifi calling, again I already knew this when I bought the phone but would be nice to have.

5. No NFC reading capability. Doesn't affect me but important to know.

I wouldn't buy this again at 250 because of these little nuances, but it truly is a good mid range phone and does last all day which is very valuable. I'd recommend just waiting till it goes on sale to get it, unless you need a phone right away.",Postif
"I purchased this in June, 2018 with some hesitation because of security concerns. When new concerns began appearing in the media in mid-July, I returned the phone while it was still within the 30 return period. To the best of my understanding, the new concerns are that the manufacturing process used by Huawei leaves the phones vulnerable. Search terms Huawei security July 2018 to learn more about the new concerns.",Negatif
"About 3 years ago I switched from Android to iPhone, because I was so frustrated by the general low hardware quality of Android phones (including those expensive galaxy), the poor power management of the OS itself forcing me to charge more than once a day and develop a battery worry syndrome, I was happy for a couple of years.

Now 3 years into iPhone ownership, I am more and more pissed off by the control freaks in Apple, and the greediness of this company, so I started research Android phones again.

My past experience told me even as expensive as galaxy, they slow down to a crawl over a few weeks after I install a bunch of apps, so I am staying away from Samsung or any expensive option.

A friend recommended this phone, I was very suspicious how good can a 200 bucks phone can be, but this is cheap enough for me even if it became a toss away toy, but I was so happily surprised.

After a few weeks, I am fully moved off my iPhone 8+ to this device, and no way I will be shifting back. It is a huge loss to US consumer to not have this brand as easily available as most other brands, and I think I understand why after having one now. Apple will be completely dead in a matter of a year or two if US market opens up to Huawei. My recommendation is get yourself these devices before more nasty trade barrier is built, then you will have no option but get ripped by Apple or Samsung.",Postif
"I always try to buy phones that can be rooted easily. I am a developer. When I purchase a new phone, the previous phone is used for development. Why not? It's my phone. I paid for it.

This company was ending their program that allowed consumers to unlock the bootloader of their phone. Although I requested the unlock code many times before the deadline, the company chose to string me along with instructions that didn't work and directed me to irrelevant or non-existentent links.

While the phone is a decent phone for the price, the fact that it will end up in a landfill somewhere greatly reduces its value and the misleading/poor customer service reduces it further.

I will not be purchasing another Huawei phone.",Negatif
"I rarely write product reviews, but in the case of this Huawei Mate SE, I felt compelled to tell other buyers like me that you will be pleased with this device provided you don't need to have NFC. Otherwise, I highly recommend this smartphone. I bought one at first to make sure that it measured up to reviews. After a short time and enjoying its performance, I bought another for my wife. She loves her's too.",Postif
"I bought this phone to not only review on my channel since I'm a tech reviewer, but also because I needed a backup phone as my main Axon 7 phone is starting to display some iffy battery life. With that being said, this phone is quite the buy and for $250 dollars you are getting one of, if not the best budget smartphone of the year for now.

The Full HD plus screen is quite eye catching and visually pleasing and you can see this even more so with some nice wallpapers in the background. The colors look more cooler and arguably more naturally looking compared to the slight oversaturation of Quad HD AMOLED displays. I love the sleek and light form factor of the phone but the design doesn't give me much of a WOW factor as compared to some other Huawei phones I've seen. While I am slightly perplexed as to why this phone comes with a micro usb port, I appreciate that they still have the 3.5mm headphone jack.

The dual camera at the back shoots some nice pictures with good dynamic range, sharpness and clarity in good lighting conditions. Video recording at 1080p 30 frames is good but with no optical image stabilization, you will need a stabilizer or small tripod to get some stable footage. There are a respectable number of filters and camera modes such as slow motion, panorama, and one of my favorites, Light Painting. The front camera, which is 8 MP, unfortunately takes some slightly out of focus face shots and its beauty mode is more of a hit or miss and looks as though it is making my face more artificial. Even when you turn it off fully, I feel that the camera is still adding the beauty effect in some shape or form. AR Lens has some face animations but they are few and won't be replacing your Snapchat animations anytime soon.

The software is EMUI 5.1 with Android 7.0. I actually have no issues with the user interface and navigating it was fluid and seamless. I like the battery management systems and the pre-installed virus scanner which is powered by Avast. The fingerprint scanner is pretty fast and possibly one of the fastest on any phone in this price range. The performance is definitely good as playing games was pretty good. I did notice that more heavily graphic intensive games, such as Asphalt 8, may lag and drop frame rates a bit but that it not always the case. Switching between apps and using multi window is done fluently on this phone.

Two main red flags were found in my experience with the phone. There seems to be an overheating issue as the phone really heats up after a while of watching Youtube videos and playing games. The temperature rises to the point that I have to hold the phone a certain way so that my palms won't be affected as much. Secondly, the single speaker grill can easily be blocked when using the phone in landscape mode and the speaker lacks good bass and loudness, even on its highest volume.

Other than those two main gripes and the slight issue with the front camera, the phone is perhaps the best budget smartphone you can buy and is great for all daily tasks and even some light to moderate gaming. I am already considering to make this phone my daily driver but only time will tell.",Postif
"This phone was issued to me for work. And it's causing some interesting issues for me. Namely what in the heck am I spending all that money monthly for my S8? A curved screen (never doing that again)? Water resistance? QHD screen? Last year's flagship specs? A stupid heart rate monitor (has anyone actually used it more than once?)? I'm really stumped here. Sure it's not as fast, doesn't have quite as good or a screen or quite as good of a camera. All I know is, it's not a $500 difference.

I'd like it to have Qi charging and water resistance, but at this price it's excusable. It has micro USB (stop crying people), so what. I'm not the clown running around the office trying to find someone with a USB C or Lightening cable because I don't have a spare and forgot to bring mine. Open drawer and PICK ONE with spares to go around! Plus it really doesn't matter since the battery is really good for a phone twice this price. It has a headphone jack for those that care... Just pointing it out. Lack of GHz WiFi. Haven't noticed it being an issue. Lack of a few obscure random AT&T or T-Mobile bands... again haven't noticed any real world issues. The stock launcher is a bit ""different"" if you're coming from Samsung or some other Android skin. Give it a week and it's no big deal. If you're coming from an iPhone it'll be quicker.",Postif
Excellent device. One star since does not get timely firmware updates.,Negatif
"I experienced the same malfunction on two of these phones. The phone goes into ""sleep"" mode after 30 seconds - and you can not change the setting once it is randomly initiated. Clearly, there is a software glitch, and I had the misfortune of having two devices affected. It doesn't happen at first but a week then 3 in both cases. I done with this phone. I need a device I can at least read through an email before shutting down.",Negatif
"This phone was great overall for the first month I had it. One thing that is a continual issue is the bluetooth, it cuts in and out while driving which is an issue being in a ""hands free"" city. I received an update notice over the weekend and applied it. Now I can no longer text photos (which the camera quality is pretty good) or receive any. This is a problem since that is a lot of my texting. I have sent in help emails and hope to have this glitch resolved ASAP.",Postif
"Hi quality full feature device for the price. Long lasting battery, no lag, solid build. Resembles the iPh0ne. Camera quality is lacking for a new device this day but is acceptable for quick snaps. I don't like the odd 18:9 ratio. No option for 3x2 size photos. My old Note 4 is superior camera quality over this. Not a deal breaker though. Again, for 250 bucks for an unlocked dual SIM phone with these specs, it's a steal.

Bought mine from B&H after seeing it in person. A+",Postif
"This is a great phone for the price, with actual performance and features you would find in upper market phones. BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW two major flaws this device has before buying it:

1. You can only use it EITHER double sim OR one sim + micro sd card. Yes, it is double sim and yes, it supports external memory, but you can only use it in the way I mentioned before because apparently Huawei engineers couldn't be bothered to provide one slot for sim cards
tray and one slot for the memory card, so the phone uses the only two-slot tray it has to accomodate the three cards, which it can't so you have to decide between double sim with no memory or one sim with memory.

2. The camera SUCKS.

If you are used to great camera phones such as Xperia (my case), Pixel, Nokia, etc, you will be very dissapointed with this phone's camera performance. It is as bad as it gets.

The rest of the features and performance, however, are only second to much more expensive phones.",Postif
This phone was the worst ever. I lost everything because was not recognizing the password.,Negatif
Beware of this brand. After a year of use I began to get pulldown ads even though I use Adblock. What finally killed it for me was when clicking on Gmail they kept trying to switch to Huaeai Gmail which says they have they right to view my mail. Reluctantly I am going to abandon the brand.,Negatif
"This phone is a viable option for those who've always been iPhone users but cannot afford the new phones. The only things I will say that are cons are that the phone's front camera isn't that great, scrolling through content is kind of choppy compared to the smooth new iPhones, and the charger isn't a USB C. Otherwise, I have absolutely no complaints. This phone is great for the money.",Postif
"Great battery life, nice build quality, excellent finger print sensor speed, and overall performance is much better than expected at this price point. This is the first non-flagship phone I've carried as a daily driver and I've been happily surprised.",Postif
"I would rate this product no star if there were such option. The Huawei Mate SE is VERY difficult to be recognized by computers & forever loading/connecting, either at home or at work. Functions are usually unstable. Got frozen frequently. I had to restart the phone on a daily basis. 2nd SIM is 2G. Swollen-headed Huawei designs its own interface, unfortunately NOT user friendly, even NOT logical. Caveat Emptor!!!!",Negatif
"It feels so cheap, something about it is just off",Negatif
"Loved this phone..
Had it about 3 months before the GPS antenna broke inside the phone. It never knew where I was, which is a massive problem for someone who already doesn't know where they are half the time.
Premium feel and design.
But performance after a month or two of use definitely suffered and ultimately rendered this phone unusable.",Negatif
"After almost a year of regular usage, I dropped the phone in water. I wasn't worried because the huawei mate se is advertised as waterproof, but after a few minutes, the power button and figerprint scanner malfunctioned. Now my phone is stuck in a loop of constantly force restarting. Very disappointed.",Negatif
"The specifications say sim slot 2 only supports 2G but I think the better description is that only 1 sim at a time will support 4G which isn't a problem for me and maybe others as well. As shown in the pictures i've uploaded, whichever sim you select as the default data sim will have 2G/3G/4G and the other will have 2G so if you want to use data from the other sim you can simply switch in settings instead of having to remove the tray and switch the cards",Postif
"Problems with GPS/Bluetooth/WIFI due to its cheap antenna. No 5ghz... then super limited LTE bands on the device... No fast charging neither, very very slow. I bought this months ago and I was disappointed.

Now that I have Stylo 4, this is so much better in every aspects...

I wouldn't buy this product if I were you, and who knows when and how Huawei will declare that they will leave the US market due to sanctions, which makes this device pretty much obsolete when it comes to future support?",Negatif

This is our second Huawei phone. We loved the speed and quality of the first one and decided to upgrade a second phone from an ASUS model. The screen size on this Mate is great especially for my large thumbs when trying to text. The phone has a great bright screen which provides good visual experience even in bright sunlight. The camera is fantastic and takes great quality pictures. This being the use of 2 lenses to get the right setting. I would recommend to family.,Postif
Believe me when I say this is the worst phone in the USA. I DARE you to research this phone and you will agree. Besides that One small drop (with a case on it) and this phone is dust. Couldn't get my pics and other files off of it and I will never by a Huawei phone again.,Negatif

"Great phone, I especially like the fingerprint reader for easy access and you can't beat the price for the tech. The only reason I can't give it 4 or 5 stars is that the black outlined text is jumbled and hard to read, (see attached photo). There is no space between the letters, it all just runs together, and is cheap looking. I downloaded a new font but it didn't change that particular text. If anyone knows how to change this particular font I'd appreciate the help. I asked in the questions section here and reached out to customer service but haven't heard back. Thanks.

Update, I decided to give it another star and keep the phone. I just hope I can change the font to make it more readable.",Postif

"The Mate SE is built very, very, well - it definitely feels like a premium phone and is an incredible value. Sticking with industrial design, the weakest points of the Mate SE are the front-facing logo (seriously, why? put a logo on the rear if you must), and the screen. The screen has a slight bit of grain to it. The grain is most visible on white content, e.g. in Google Now or if you open a new tab in Chrome. Might not be an issue for some.

The WORST thing about the SE is the software. It only ships with android 7.0, and EMUI is *awful*. I installed Nova, and even tried out a few EMUI themes to try and get the quick settings & settings menu to be more like stock Android. Then I found that Huawei had also replaced Android's standard 'share' menu (e.g. when one shares a photo from Google Photos to WhatsApp) with their own inferior version.

Huawei: please join the 'android one' program, and ship stock Android on your phones. This will also make it easier for you to provide OS updates for your phones.

If the Mate SE had stock Android, it would be fantastic. I can't accept EMUI though, and have returned the phone as a consequence. I highly recommend that anyone considering this phone purchase the Xiaomi Mi A1 instead - that's what I did. The Mi A1's build quality is excellent, it has no front-facing logo, and it is part of the android one initiative, running stock Android 8.0 - it is incredible. (It does have larger top & bottom bezels than the Mate SE, but in all other aspects the Xiaomi Mi A1 is better, or at least as good.)

Do NOT buy the Mate SE - get the Xiaomi Mi A1!

"I ordered this phone for my mother. Everything was great with the setup except when we tried to connect to WiFi, we kept getting an error ""WiFi - Denied Access to Network"". We tried everything to include resetting the phone back to factory settings. Still no luck! Other phones connected to the house WiFi with no problems. I ordered a replacement phone. I'll update my review.....only if it works like its supposed to.

Update: I finally discovered a fix by accident. First...take the phone to a carrier store to have them set it up and connect it to their network. My mother is on T-mobile. Second...go to a public place like Starbucks and use their wi-fi to complete all the phone updates. Headsup...you will be there for a while so make sure you have plenty of power. Once finished you should be on latest Android version 7.1. You can now go home and connect to your personal network. The phone no longer has any issues nor receive that stupid error anymore.

For example, you set the screen brightness to 50%, you put the phone down and after a minute you pick it up. The brightness will be set to 25% only and this is very annoying since you have to readjust it every time.

"What a great phone, BUT WHAT A SHAME, NO 5GHz WiFi!
Once you see this phone in person, You'd be W O W ! ! !
This is such a very SLEEK phone and very fast.
Everything on this phone is really good. Screen occupies most of the face, and the buttons can be customized since they are on the display.
I was going crazy finding my wifi router just to FIND OUT THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz. My my router is dual band, but can only transmit either 2.4 or 5GHz, not both at the same time. My kids won't let me choose 2.4 since it's slower and 2.4 is obviously not as good as the 5GHz.
I am not going to mention all the good stuffs, since there is too much of them.

BUT HERE ARE THE CONS:
- NO 5GHz WiFi
- NO WiFi Calling
- NO Wireless charging capability
- NOT a Type C fast charging
- If these things don't bother you, BUY IT, no brainer

I use T-Mobile. At my work, inside the building, only Verizon works. AMAZINGLY, I was able to use this phone ( with one bar). No iPhones or Samsung ever worked at my work unless your WiFi calling is ON or have Verizon. Although, this don't have Wi-Fi calling, I was able to use it at work.

I'm not really sure what I'm paying for. It's more expensive than the most expensive Blu phones and yet the performance is nowhere near on par. The OS is laggy and apps open slower than on a lower end phone. Why the hell should I have to enter a lock screen password after 3 days if i'm the only person in the world who has my fingerprint?

"I've been using the Mate SE for the past few days and thought I'd leave a review to help others decide when considering this phone. I've been a Google Nexus (5, 5X, 6P) user for the past several years, so leaving Google devices was a leap of faith for me, but my 6P was experiencing the cold battery shutoff at 40+% issue so it was time to try something new.

I want to add a disclaimer that I am including the price point as a major part of my decision to give the phone 4 (really 4.5) stars. I mean, THIS PHONE IS $229!!!

A second disclaimer is that I am by no means a power user. My typical uses for my phone are texting, web browsing, watching youtube videos, navigation, some social media, and taking photos. I do not game on my phones, so my review is not evaluating gaming performance.

The Pros:
-Smooth operation. For my everyday use, the speed of opening apps and switching between apps is great and I have no major complaints. There are occasional times when scrolling isn't quite as smooth as on my 6P or my girlfriends S8+, but this is also being nit picky. Again, 95% of the time its great.
-Great screen. The screen is big, the bezels are small, the picture is clear and sharp and the colors are accurate to my eyes. The auto brightness feature also works quickly and seems to adjust to a comfortable level based on the surrounding lighting.
-Premium feel. I've been using the phone without a case since I got it and I like how the aluminum body feels in my hand, although it is a little slippery. The buttons feel nice and solid
-Fast fingerprint scanner. The finger print scanner is at least as fast as the 6P if not faster, and is quite accurate. I've only had it miss my finger print a handful of times and it was likely my fault for bad placement
-Slim design. Because of the small bezels and the thinness of the phone, the mate SE is easier to carry in my pocket than the 6P.
-Headphone jack! It has a damn headphone jack for those of us that haven't cut the cord on our headphones yet.
-Availability of themes. Having used stock android for the last few years, I didn't particularly like the stock EMUI theme that ships with the phone, but there are theme packs available for download on the play store that allow you to change the theme to pixel, oreo, etc.
-Battery performance. Again I'm not a power user, but I have been consistently making it through the day with 60% battery remaining when I plug my phone in before going to sleep.
-VALUE!!! During my research for a new phone, this phone offered the best features for the price. Hands down.
-Camera IN GOOD LIGHT. In daylight or bright light the camera is actually pretty good if you have a steady hand. The pro mode on the camera allows for pretty decent picture taking if you are willing to adjust some settings. I also like the bokeh/low aperature mode for taking macro shots. Its not as good as the pixel camera, s8/s9 or iphone but its pretty decent IN GOOD LIGHTING.

The Mehs:
-Bloatware. There isn't a ton of bloatware, but it is a bit annoying that you can't uninstall most of the apps that ship with the phone. I prefer to use the google apps, and I can't delete the stock email app, calendar app, etc. Not a huge deal, but meh.
-Nougat. the Mate SE ships with nougat, although a google search will show that Huawei is beta testing Oreo for the 7X and an updated EMUI. Hopefully the stable version is released this spring or summer.
-Typing mistakes. I seem to make more mistakes typing on this phone than my 6P for some reason. Perhaps it is the screen protector I have on it which isn't the best. just something to note, not a huge deal.

The Bads:
-Camera in low light. I'm just going to be honest here, the camera is terrible in low light compared to my 6P. Google is king of image processing and the Mate SE is no where close to any google device in low light camera performance. Keep in mind though, that this phone is also 1/3rd the price of the Pixel 2 and almost a 1/4 the price of the Pixel 2 XL, so a worse camera in some situations is expected at this price point.

Overall, if you are in the market for a new phone, and don't want to spend close to $1000 for a new flagship, the Mate SE is definitely a phone to consider if you don't mind the poor low light camera performance. Everything else with the phone feels on par with other big name phones, for a fraction of the price!",Postif
"I recently came from the Samsung Galaxy S8, as my relative needed a phone, and I wanted to be free of my financing plan.

That being said, I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. The Mate SE is a great phone. Here are a summary of points I liked about the phone:

Pros:
-Great Camera. Lots of options like AR mode, Pro Mode, Document Scanner, Food mode etc. High quality 18 MP dual lens system.
-EMUI is updated to Andriod 8.0 Oreo for a smooth running system with features like live screen recording, split screen, and more.
-Dual Sim unlocked, and SD card ready. SD card can be formatted or separate storage, which is nice.
-Performance with 4 GB of ram and 64 GB of storage is blazing fast, especially with the Kirin chipset.
-Screen resolution is nice, especially for the price, colors pop and are bright, but its not as extremely crisp as a Galaxy screen.
- Quick Charge enabled. Can charge 0 to 100 in around an hour and a half. Battery is also large and if used from 100% at 7 am can go up to 45% at 11:30 pm meaning more than enough for a day of use. (Medium use at half brightness).
- Comes with a case, always a perk. Case isn't top tier BUT its rigid enough for the job.
- Screen is bigger than my old Galaxy S8, relative's Iphone 8 plus and Iphone x. Full Screen mode works flawlessly and is better than flagship full screens.
- Speaker is loud and booming with no distortion at max volume.
- One handed mode comes in handy and makes usage easier.
- Fingerprint sensor is quick, easy, and conveniently placed, way better than the Galaxy S8!

Now on to the Cons:

- While the camera is amazing, low light selfies and pics will be a bit fluffy, although the flash can fix that.
- The phone uses micro USB, which is fine, its an advanced version of the port, but I would've liked to see USB type C.
- Screen resolution is high, but some apps looked better on the Galaxy S8. But for the price its not a deal breaker at all. Screen is more than enough.

All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this phone for anyone who wants a flagship experience for $249.99, and wants to be free of contracts and financing. Im extremely happy with this purchase and don't regret switching from the Galaxy S8.",Postif
"I love this phone!! I swear, this is totally the best phone I've ever had!

I just bought this phone a few days ago to replace my Huawei Honor 5X. It arrived yesterday and I'm very pleased with it!

The speed is amazing and light-years faster than the older model (Honor 5X) and the fingerprint scanner is excellent. A quick touch to the back of the phone and it's immediately unlocked. I love that!

The camera works great and is very responsive. There is hardly any delay when taking pictures.

The Honor 5X I had before this one lasted a long time. I had it well over a year at least and I had dropped it numerous times on hard floors and concrete without it ever breaking the screen. I expect this one will be just as durable.

If you're looking for a phone with great features, durability, and a high quality feel, this is by far the the best phone for the price.",Postif
"Yes, there is something missing or not as good, but, for this price tag and what it offers, it is an excellent phone. Highly recommended. It has everything you really need.
No NFC (Near Field Communications): You cannot ""Google Pay"" wirelessly, period; No 5Ghz WiFi (You have to stay at crowded 2.4Ghz. It is fine. You really don't feel you miss anything); No replaceable battery; No wireless/fast charging; No water-proof; No high speed USB 3.0; No stereo speakers; No gyroscope (do you really need it?); No native WiFi Calling (if you are a T-Mobile customer, you can use ""T-Mobile DIGITS"" doing WiFi Calling); Camera is not as good at Low Light condition, and without Image Stabilizer (but it is not bad at all and the built-in Camera app has a lot functions.16+2M dual main at f2.2 and 8M front at f2.0); Use old micro-USB port without Type-C (which I like the ""old"" micro-USB that I can use all my chargers and power banks.); And, it has FM radio (yes, good) using 3.5 mm audio (I like the 3.5 mm) headset (not provided) as its antenna; Great 5.93 inch 18:9 display at 1080p x 2160p, 407 ppi (though it is not OLED, great display); Beautiful metal case with clear-color soft TPU protection case; 4GB RAM with 64GB storage (still not enough storage? you can insert in a micro-SD card up to 256GB); Dual-nano-SIM (2nd SIM only for 2G); Excellent finger print sensor with gesture controls; EMUI interface is actually pretty good. You can select between drawer or standard mode; not many ""other"" apps (if you don't use it, you can delete or disable it.)... and it is built by HUAWEI, a big brand in China and Europe.",Postif
"PRO:
Very fast, much faster than Moto G5, no problem to play games. My first phone with Kirin CPU, not sure it is the CPU or large RAM made this phone faster than Moto G5.
The fingerprint scan is accurate and fast.
The camera is good, both front and rear, a little overexposed some time.
Charging is fast, it takes about 90 minutes to get fully charged.
EMUI has a lot of features, very easy to access flashlight, calculator...
Install google launcher, ""Google now/feed"" works. (It does not work on Moto G5).
The price is great, for $229, cannot get any phone better than this.

CONS:
WIFI is only 2.4GHz, it will be a trouble with a lot of neighbors.
MicroUSB 2.0 but not Type-C? Huawei had too many spare parts?
Many pre-installed apps? I'm assuming Huawei get paid to install those apps.",Postif
"I wish I had heard of this company before buying all these second hand Samung/Motorola phones through craigslist just to save money, when I can buy a comparable phone brand new for a price that is cheaper. This phone is just an improved version of the Honor 7X.

My review is based off replacing a Samsung Note 4 and my work phone is a Galaxy S7.

Battery:
The battery life is superb on this. Seeing how my Note 4 had all this bloatware and these Samsung extras out of the box. The Note 4 couldn't even last through out the day with constant usage. This phone lasts through out the day, set it down without charging it for the night and it still has power.
Battery life is about the same as the S7, though.

Design:
Doesn't feel like a cheap, cricket phone. Feels like it has some weight, some heft to it. I am also impressed by the fingerprint technology on the back of the handset. It is much better and responsive then what the Galaxy S7 has. I never had to 'retry' my fingerprint as if it didn't register it.

Communications:
Haven't noticed any difference in terms of call quality or signal. Yet, my carrier is AT&T. The only concern is that the phone doesn't support 5G Wi-Fi.

Camera.
Unless something was wrong with my Samsung Note 4, this camera is much better than the Note, but similar to what the S7 has, or maybe even less.

Display:
I can't tell if this is part of the android or part of Huawei, but there are animations in the display which are interesting. From where you can see the display brightness slider move automatically to where texts seem to 'bounce' when you scroll through them. There is little bloatware and I like the drawer design of the apps. Screen is also bigger than my Note 4.

Also some people state the charging cable is different, yet my cord that charges my samsung phones can charge this phone.

At the end of the day, this phone can do everything a $1,200 phone can do.

Update Six Months Later:
Phone still going strong. My only major issue is that GPS is horrible with this phone. From Waze to Google Maps, the signal isn't consistent and drops when it comes to GPS. Never experienced anything like this, and it's been like this day one.",Postif
"----------------------------------------------------UPDATE 08/28/2018------------------------------------------------------------------------
Going to 1 star. So I contacted Huawei support to find out why my the phone keeps closing apps automatically even the apps you tell it not to automatically optimize. It still closes those apps. This is the worst support call I've ever had. To cut a long story short, the support rep told me that all my apps not compatible with Huawei so I need to contact all the developers and ask them why their apps are not compatible with huawei and that's why they're closing. Are you kidding me?!!!!! ... Contact every single developer for every App on my phone. Even the Huawei Phone Manager App closes. My goodness they're stupid.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE.
------------------------------------------Original Review----------------------------------------------------------------
The phone is OK .. the response time when you click an app is really slow and noticeable. I guess that's what you get on a budget phone with a Kirin processor instead of a snapdragon.
----------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE July 2018---------------------------------------------------------
After using this for a few months, it's worse than I thought. A big negative for this phone is that it automatically closes apps even those that you don't want closed. If you have the banking app that notifies you about real time purchases when your card is used, forget it, will never work on this phone because it keeps killing the apps from running in the background. Even after setting the apps not to optimize, that feature is just there but doesn't do anything because Huawei disabled it. Very annoying. Also seeing that they've decided not to stop giving out the bootloader unlock code, this phone is more useless to me than a tree branch. This is my first and definitely my last Huawei phone.",Negatif
"UPDATE: Released Android 8.0 today, 5/16/2018. Update is nice and seems quicker navigating apps.

I've had the phone for a little over the week, and it's just plain awesome. I am a techy, however, I didn't want to spend $700-1000 on the new flagship phones. This has exceeded my expectations by far: the processing is extremely fast, the fingerprint is flawless, the EMUI is neat, and the camera is awesome as well. My wife has an iPhone 7 ($750) from At&t and this Mate SE beats it spec wise except for a few things. In my comparing, the iPhone 7 has 4k video recording, and 1080p recording with the front facing camera. However, the front facing camera of this Mate SE has 720p recording which is still high quality. The Mate SE does not film in 4k, however, in my opinion, it makes up for this with the variable apperture. The screen for the Mate SE is very large and has a good brightness with auto-brightness adjustment sensitivity. It is very clear and responsive to your touch. Day to day tasks are a breeze, email, internet, YouTube, etc. You will enjoy your new phone, even if your coming from the top brands.

P.s. this phone has a document explorer with a great UI. I know this will come in handy for downloading files and reopening them.

Overall I rate 5 ??. You just can't beat the quality for price.",Postif
"Not much to add as far as what others have already said about this phone. I too was coming off a 3 year old Galaxy S6 Edge which is now in its time to fail period. This phone blows it away in almost every aspect and the S6 was the premium flagship that outclassed the previous versions by quite a lot. Now budget phones are beating the former best phones on the market not that long ago, truly amazing. This modified Android I actually like better then stock, it's simple and intuitive. Internet, fingerprint reader, everything is just fast! Love that it still has a straight headphone jack! Don't you dare change that please!
Camera is more then good enough but I'm not a picture fanatic so it might not work for those looking for real high end photos from a phone. The AMOLED screen of the old Galaxies are still better then this but not enough to not still make this phone overall better hardware/price wise. The only con I see is not directly related to the phone, and that is case availability. I used to love that Otterbox Defender with a built in screen protector available for previous Galaxy versions. Sadly Otterbox has mostly given up on that and making cases for any other manufacturers besides Apple and Samsung. I ordered a soft pouch for extra protection. I do like that this is a plus size phone, I will never go back to smaller. Buy this phone, you will not be disappointed.",Postif
"I got this phone yesterday on 6/2/18 and am mostly very pleased. I will update if things change but here's my initial opinion on this phone.

Screen/display: 10/10 - crisp, bright, beautiful display. It reminds me of using an iPhone OS.

Speed: 10/10- no lags, fingerprint sensor opens lightning fast. No hiccups so far. I like that I can add multipe fingerprints and can use the fingerprint to open certain secure apps on my phone.

GPS: 6/10 - I've only used it once, but I think it was a little uncertain as to where I was. Good thing I actually knew where I was going. But GPS is something I highly depend on so I'm a little disappointed. Will use more and update as needed.

------ 6/5/18 UPDATE: GPS 10/10 - I've since changed some settings on my GPS to make it more accurate. It is very fast with finding my location,and re-routing if necessary, and GPS signal seems to be accurate.

Camera: 7/10 -coming from a Blu studio one which took pretty decent pics (I think was 12 mp) and a Samsung Galaxy amp prime which took very average pictures (with an even lower mp rating), I'm not overly impressed or disappointed. The camera is ok, but nothing too incredible in my opinion.

Sound: 5/10 - I feel this is very quiet. I had alarms wake me which I barely heard. I turned the volume up so we will see if that solves. Sound clarity on calls appears decent. As someone who connects phone to car via Bluetooth daily, I was pretty disappointed in lack of bass while playing songs. I will test it out more and update accordingly.

Battery: 8/10 - I got the phone about 60% charged and when I went to charge to 100, it took at least 2-3 hours. I was surprised at how slowly it seemed to charge. I slept with it on the charger last night since I like to start the day at 100% so today will be the first day on full battery to test the battery life.

------ 6/5/18 UPDATE: Battery 9.5/10. I just used my phone from 100% to 2% (it wouldn't discharge below that, and gave a 30 second warning stating the phone was shutting off because the battery is empty). It lasted 2 full days ( I was hoping I could get 2.5 or 3 days) without additional charging and that it with a lot of screen-on time surfing the web, downloading apps, social media, etc (nothing too heavy like gaming). While I was at work today I did not check my phone however the charge seemed to stay pretty much put as I hoped it would do (even with syncs, wifi, GPS/location, and Bluetooth all turned on). I have had phones that would discharge as much as 10-20% just sitting in my purse/locker untouched. Also, I put it on the charger tonight when it died and it charged up from 2% to 75% in less than 1 hour. I'm not sure why the initial partial charge took so long, but this seems promising!

Again, I've had the phone for less than 24 hours, so this is just my initial review and will change as I use and experience it more.",Postif
"Overall I'm pleased with the phone. It has just about every feature I'd want at a price point that is sane. Updated to Oreo right away. Not perfectly responsive but way better than I'm used to. I've read about a lot of problems with Huawei and Fitbit devices, but my Charge 2 seems to be working fine after some patience with it's first sync. EMUI is fine; just a different flavor of essentially the same stuff as stock Android. A nice surprise was FM radio is supported with wired headphones plugged in and a preloaded app. Also it comes with a decent clear case.

Can't necessarily complain about it having USB micro, non-AMOLED screen, GSM only, single speaker. If you want the whole enchilada go buy a phone that is four times the price.

My few unpleasant surprises:
* The biggest one: no support for wake with ""Ok Google"". You'll have to press a button on screen every time you want to give voice commands. I actually miss this from my Nexus 5X that died and kind of expect it on any Android phone now. Kind of a big deal. Otherwise this might have been five stars.
* The automatic screen brightness tends to adjust too dark fairly often and I need to turn it back up.
* Bluetooth seems to stutter audio streams randomly (half second of silence then continued audio occasionally) but not often or consistent enough to warrant returning the phone.
* Camera is not great for low light or even moderate motion is bright daylight. Your dog will need to be still if you want crisp pictures.
* Huawei has their own OS-integrated versions of basic apps such as contacts, dialer, SMS, music that you can't uninstall. Whatever though. Maybe someday we'll get stock Android.",Postif
"There is no other way to put it, this is an excellent device at excellent value. The only complaint I have is the confusion with how many devices there are from Huawei for different markets. I purchased 2 phones BEFORE this one. First a Nexus 6P (more for Google, but because Huawei built this phone I was more comfortable trying a pure Huawei phone afterwards) then an Honor 7X. This is where I had some trouble, because I purchased the international version, which was not made clear as to what networks it supports in the U.S, and many different websites have conflicting information based on whether you pull up the 3GB RAM model VS the 4GB RAM model. It's difficult to have confidence in your purchase when buying elsewhere, but buying the Mate SE from Amazon definitely gave me security and confidence in the choice I was making.

As for the device. WOW... I knew I wanted to get it for the extra gig of ram and the Octa-core processor, but this phone continues to impress. I haven't had a single hick-up or issue with anything so far, if it weren't for the network issue I would have never gotten rid of the 4GB RAM 7X, the Mate SE makes you very happy that Huawei is working with American distributors because this is a very underrated device. Shipped and arrived next-day, effortless sync, Android experience is smooth, and I do like the skins though I haven't changed any themes myself. Camera is ultra-responsive, finger-print is incredibly accurate and unlocks quicker than half-a second, which is hard to comprehend for the price and something I noticed was also equally responsive on the 7X. Just overall incredibly impressed. Oh and there's a free case which ships with the phone as well, which is just an unexpected plus that makes you happy you chose to support this company.

In all honesty, I feel like if OnePlus weren't trying to compete on upper-tier financial markets they would be cranking out phones like this no problem, but they're missing a chance to compete with yet another market that is making unparalleled devices for an unbelievable cost. For the first time my phone has as much RAM as my laptop and I didn't pay too much...",Postif
"Oh my goodness I love this phone. Why would you play 700 800-900 $1,000 for a phone when you can get this one. It's fast it's easy. I love it much more than my Samsung S6. I have Cricket as my carrier and all I did was take the SIM card out of my S6 and put it into this phone. I'm very very pleased with this phone",Postif
"Good phone for the money with one MAJOR flaw for me. This phone can't stream to Bluetooth and do WiFi at the same time. WiFi speeds become unusable. Tried to figure out why. Looks like they share the same antennae on the phone. Bummed out as I use Bluetooth headsets daily. (I have had other budget phones that handle the Bluetooth and WiFi issue just fine.) Other than this it's a good phone for the money. Surprised because the build quality other than this is good.

2nd radio/issue found - GPS. GPS is less accurate than other phones. I compared to 4 other phones I own and this one is the furthest out of calibration/inaccurate. I expected it to not be as good as my Samsung Note 5 but it also got beat by a phone half it's price. If GPS is something you depend on (especially in the vertical/alt side) then this may not be the phone for you. I tried with 2 different Mate SE's and both have the same problem. Maybe they can add some correction in software but I am assuming it is an antennae / metal body issue.

So much about this phone is great but it really struggles on radios which is essential to a phone. Disappointed because otherwise would be great!",Negatif
"Bought this for my wife after her Samsung finally gave up the ghost. I am one of those cranky old farts that feels cellphone prices are close to obscene. That being said I did some pretty extensive research on affordable phablets/phones and kept coming up with Huawei. While it lacks some of the uber cutting edge whiz-bangery of the latest iFarce or Samsung Pocket Lighter, it does have an excellent camera and a processor that is fast enough to work any app one would use.
Aesthetically pleasing, easy to work and about five hundred bucks less than one of the previously mentioned overpriced over-hyped wallet rapers, this phone strikes a sweet spot for those of us that need performance without paying Ferrari prices for a dang phone.",Postif
"Even cell phone pros were impressed. I had my reservations, I have had quite a few smartphones over the years, and have only owned the Nexus 6p from Huawei. They had improved significantly from the 6p. Buttons have good feel, phone is snappy, software is decent. Camera quality is pretty good, but slightly overexposed in my short time with it.

Bought for my mother in law, and there was no sense in getting a $1,000 phone that will mostly be used for calling. For what it is, I could genuinely see using this phone as a daily driver if I were short on cash. Obviously I prefer my Pixel 2 XL, but I can tell you this is one darn decent phone. Battery is above my expectations as well. Screen is bright, and big. Easier on older eyes with the Android software letter increase size.

If you're looking for something ""good enough"", this phone is a hit. Politically, I don't care what Uncle Sam says about the espionage potential of Huawei. If you are worried about that, avoid smartphones in general. Could snag up a big roll o tin foil too....",Postif
"I've had this phone several weeks and I love it. My battery lasts in to the second day. I surf the internet quickly and effortlessly, the camera is better then adequate, the response time is lightning quick, gaming (though I don't do much) has no lag time, and as a phone and texter absolutely no complaints. Is it as good as a flagship phone? No. There is a reason they cost three and four times as much. The thing is I don't need whatever those reasons are. And that's what you should be asking yourself. Is it ego, or do I really need that flagship phone? Because if you don't then buy this one. It's a great performer, with a fabulous display and a build that should last a very long time.",Postif
"Ok so I'm terribly rough on phones. A decent ones last me a year hopefully. This one has been great so far. Only complaint is Android auto doesn't seem to work. Tried two different cables and keep getting a no connection error. The thing that sold me to buy another::;
I crushed this phone with a pressure tank to the shape a mild c. I was pretty upset after having it only two weeks. Picked it up and the screen was not cracked. In fact I bent it back to almost normal shape and it is amazingly working as normal still. No glitches screen cracks or anything. This is almost as bullet proof a phone as any I've seen. Super glad I'm not replacing it already. Specs seem good and all loads and downloads seem fast and equivalent to an upper end smart phone. Bottom line is I will need to buy one for when I inevitably kill this one but for now, a 400 lb pressure tank didn't kill it so I'm pretty happy.",Postif
"I work in IT so my tech level is really high. This is an AMAZING phone! I mean granted I don't own the IphoneX or Note9 but I do have to say, the fingerprint reader is sooo fast. The facial recognition is sooo fast. Screen is sharp and VERY responsive. There were 2 or 3 updates I ran which brought the phone to EMUI 8 and Androind 8. It's just amazing. For so much speed and quality at such a cheap price I can't imagine any better. I know diminishing returns would occur for higher end phones. Don't get me wrong. I am sure flagships are better, faster, whatever. For me though, this is beyond expectations! people looked as asked of is that the new samsung? And I grin ear to ear! Nope, it was just over 200! and their faces are priceless! I am not at all worried about China tracking my movements. Nor should anyone else! That is a political mind game. The FBI, CIA, NSA, and Homeland security have been able to do that since 2000! If, by chance you are one who can not be tracked and MUST stay under the radar. I would suggest do not buy technology. The screen is bright, bright enough for me. There are many little nuances that make me really appreciate the phone. It's quick enough to charge. But, wow I really really like it.

I shopped around the only other thing I might have changed is the new ""pocophone"" might be better but was ~70 more and too new to get my hands on. In the future I might look at that line.",Postif
"Huawei has made such incredible strides by leaps and bounds and at a blistering pace that they were technically run out of the US. Ridiculous shame. Here you have a phone, as with all their phones, that has excellent battery life, a really nice screen, acceptable sound, and everything on it works pretty much flawlessly. And all of this for just under 250 bucks. I still have my Galaxy Note 8, and about 5 minutes off the charger at around the same screen brightness of the Mate, the battery begins to deplete. At 100 percent battery, it can be well over 30 minutes before the Mate begins to deplete. They can put a 5000+ mah battery in the high end phones (like Samsung), and the incredible quality of their screens is still going to race right through that battery. Why does anyone need a supposed high end, super bright phone? And frankly, how many people use the seemingly 75,000 tricks and this and that on these so-called flagship phones?? Most of the stuff on them that supposedly consumers want, but honestly you will rarely if at all use, is simply useless. At 250 bucks I am hard pressed to see any kind of real difference that a 1000 plus dollar phone. It takes calls flawlessly (my note 8 has issues with calls, especially on Bluetooth), it works well searching on the net, screen is plenty bright at just over 50%, sound is more than acceptable (I am not looking to use it as my stereo), and I don't game so I could care less for that. Build on it is solid. The added case is more than acceptable. I don't understand how it is people are constantly dropping their phones! It comes with all you need out of the box, minus headphones. Great unit for 250 bucks - period.",Postif
"I have had all types of phones. I have owned both Android and iPhone. I decided to buy a device and have money left over. This is the perfect device. This phone is fast, has a great screen and the battery life is the best that I've had.
I've owned the device for almost a month and I am completely satisfied. The size of the screen is awesome and the phone can be easily held in the hand. I love that it also comes with a case. Just pop your sim card in and go! I'd like to think that Im into media consumption and this is the best device. If you want a great device and don't want to spend $1000, this is the device for you!",Postif
"If you need a new smartphone and have a GSM carrier (AT&T or T-Mobile), this is a great phone for the money. 4GB of RAM means plenty of room for all your applications (unlike my 2GB Moto G4 that kept force-closing apps if I opened more than one at a time) and activation was a snap: just remove the SIM card from your old phone and put in this one. Porting everything over was a breeze thanks to Huawei's app that copies over all your apps, pictures, etc. I find the OS to be snappy and responsive. The built-in launcher (EMUI) isn't the greatest, but a quick installation of Nova Prime solved that. All in all, this phone is highly recommended!",Postif
"So far so good. This is by far the highest quality mid grade phone I've ever seen at this price point. 4gb ram and 64gb with a surprisingly decent camera. I'm using it with metro PCS and it's flawless so far.

Operating system:
Upgraded to Android 8.0 Oreo.. it's buttery.
Smooth transitions from app to app and very little lag, if any at all.

Display: absolutely stunning at this price point. I'm used to the Galaxy AMOLED screens and the screen on this phone is the closest I've seen to AMOLED at this price point.

Battery life:
So far it's pretty standard. Don't love it, don't hate it.

OVERALL: I certainly feel that I've gotten my moneys worth. The phone isn't plastic either, it feels and looks like a $800+ flagship phone. This phone is sort of like an Android and an iPhone had a baby. Blown away and very happy with my purchase. Even came with a clear phone case.

I will update this review in a few months and let you know if the phone is worth 8t in the long run.

1 month after purchase:

Phone is still working perfectly without any major issues. I have to say, I'm blown away by the battery life on this phone. I'm the guy with his nose in his phone 24/7 and I rarely go below 50% battery life.

Only thing I can say that I've experienced that isn't so fun is the response time of the touch screen. Scrolling isn't as fluid as my old Samsung and sometimes I have to tap something more than once to get it to go.",Postif
"For the Price this is not a bad budget mid range phone. VOLTE works on Mint Mobile (mvno of T-Mobile). This phone does not support WIFI calling. It does have T-Mobile bands 2,4,12 - but is missing 66 and 71 for other main bands used. With that said I have not had a connection issue in my location. Out of the Box this phone updated to Oreo 8.0.0.341(C567). With Huawei budget phones though I am not sure how long they will support updates though. Unfortunately Huewei does not allow unlocked bootloaders as of this spring so keeping the phone up to date in the long run with Community Builds is not an option. Overall the phone does have 64 gb storage for a 2018 budget phone and does work well when paired with T-Mobile and it's MVNO's with the correct APN settings.

Other Notes: The Phone only has 2.4 Ghz Wifi, which does work well - would be nice to have 5Ghz. The Bluetooth paired with both of my cars - however it is choppy compared to my Oneplus 3T. Also the GPS is not a real strong suit for this phone. I was able to succusfully use GPS Status & Toolbok to help calibrate the GPS to within error of 4.9m which is pretty good. Micro USB is a dissapointment to have instead of USC C - not the end of the world. no NFC. Camera is very sub par in low light.",Postif
"Drawback: I can't see the screen while wearing sunglasses. Other than that PERFECT. When I needed a phone, I always bought the latest Samsung from the factory. Out right, no payments and completely free of any company owned soft/bugware. Recently my car was broken into and my phone and backup phone were stolen. This time I decided to see what was outdere other than Samsung and I found this. Let me tell you, it's FAST, I'm a super user, not social media but actual work programs running all day and it doesn't skip a beat. It's beautiful, and if you had told me that it was a Samsung I would have believed you! Thanks Samsung for all those wonderful years we spent together but this is goodbye for me, I'm with someone who loves me just as much but doesn't cost a fortune, I'm with Huawei.",Postif
"I buy alot of smartphones. Typically, just flagship devices. This is my first budget/mid-range buy in years. I purchased because my old S6 Edge Plus would last about 2 hours SOT before dying. Where I work I need a reliable battery so after some research and not wanting to spend much money, this and the essential phone were the options.

What I can say is this.. The phone performs as good or better than my $1200 galaxy S6, except in sound and camera. The camera will definitely bum you out if you're used to having the higher end Google, Sansung or Apple devices. But, in good lighting it's not half bad for HDR shots. In low light or in video though you'll start seeing where it falls short. The sound.. pretty bad. Kind of loud but ""tin can"" sounding and actually hurts at full volume (high pitch, zero low end sound)

For the good.. This thing is quick, quicker than expected. After a week of use Ive had zero crashes or lagg at all. It works very fluid. And the battery is the best part! Ive had the screen on for over an hour and I am at 91%.. I'm not used to that. Sure, the Essential phone would have had a better processor and camera (maybe) but with 4 gigs of ram, and a killer SOC and Battery, I'm very glad I went this route.

It is slippery, and though they do provide a case (pretty cool Huawei!) it's just about as slippery. I'd really recommend getting the Poetic or Spigin case on Amazon when you order.

I definitely recomend this phone! And service on t-mobile in norther california is great. My old Galaxy wouldnt get phone calls in my house, this one does. So it even has better radio/antennas then a phone that costs 4x as much. Huawei wanted to get a cheap device in america almost at cost, to get people more into them, and it's working. This thing is a powerhouse and could have easily cost 400+ is it had ""Samsung"" stamped on it somewhere and people would buy it.

One last note.. if you're into the iPhone's look but not the software, this phone is the one for you. Almost identical to a 7+, with excellent build quality just like Apple.

Hoe this helps! If anyone needs help just send a message and I'm happy to answer any questions.",Postif
"Excellent quality and workmanship, Greatest cell phone with powerful processor and has all the functionality of much more expensive cell phone. Works great with ATT as the carrier. I absolutely love the phone and recommend it highly AAA+++. The only negative aspects are the the fact that the built in Wi Fi is only 2.4 ghz and not 5 ghz making it impossible to connect with my home Wi Fi. If they make the phone with 5 ghz 802.11a Wi Fi, they would double their sales, second draw back is camera quality is mediocre and the charging cable that comes with the phone is only three feet, way to short could not not even reach my bed night table. I bought a six feet cable and problem resolved. It is absolutely the best cell phone for the price. I highly recommend it, Buy it now and you too will Love it !!!",Postif
"After losing my 4th iPhone to water damage (my own fault), I just couldn't justify purchasing another $700-$1000 phone. Apple makes great products,but their premium tech comes at a premium price. This forced me to look towards android. I saw this phone on amazon with exceptional ratings and I decided to take the leap.

After a week of use, All I can say is Wow! What an amazing phone, especially considering the price tag. It feels like a device that's two to three times more expensive and comes loaded with a crazy amount of tech. As a longtime apple fan, I've gotta say that this is pretty amazing. The screen is beautiful, the processor is faster than my iPhone 6, the 64 gigs is more than substantial (I installed a 64g micro SD (another benefit over apple) so memory is effectively 128g), and the fingerprint sensor is faster and more effective than any sensor I've used before. It's thin, lightweight, feels good in the hand and the nav buttons are intuitive and easy to use. Perhaps my favorite feature is the battery. Even as I write this review I've been using the device pretty heavily today (at least 7 hours of moderate to heavy use) and I'm still sitting at 82% battery. That's phenomenal.

The front camera is great, mostly when using the pro mode, although it's easy to wash out pics especially in high sun without adjusting the settings. The selfie camera does leave a bit to be desired (image quality seems lower than the 8mp they advertise, sometimes appearing grainy) but that's not a huge deal for me. My final caveat is the speaker. It's fine for browsing videoes and that sort of thing but don't expect it to get loud. I almost struggled to hear calls while on speaker phone with minimal-moderate background noise. It's not a huge deal since I just switched it over to the ear piece and the call quality was clear and loud.

Bottom line, this is the best phone I've ever owned considering the amount of tech vs the price tag. It easily feels like a $500-$600 device. I'm a fan.

PS the Chinese government has yet to contact me and my credit card accounts remain secure. I think we can stand on the huawei tech threat.",Postif
"So, all of you have likely read a lot of pros and cons about the phone. I did likewise and thought-Wow...finally a very good (not excellent, but thats not necessary) for a very reasonable price. So I got it. Initially really liked it...big display, fairly quick, etc... Eventually did not work out. Here is why (1) Processor speed-I use the gps a lot. I found that too many times, I was just passing the street when it told me to turn...that never happened with my Galaxy. (2) related to this, GPS was more inaccurate than any other phone I had bought in recent years. I heard some other reviews say this, but ignored. I live in Boston and need high accuracy. (3) phone quality-I also changed cell phone carriers so not sure to blame the phone or the carrier, but got terrible reception at my house and other locations. (4) minor compared to the rest, but the sound quality of the speaker was a big step down. Eventually, I ended up biting the bullet and getting a new Galaxy...I am not in deep love with it either, but wow, the processor is amazing...so fast!!! I just noticed that Amazon dropped the price again of the S9, so not as cost prohibitive...might want to at least consider that or another phone.",Postif
Fantastic little phone. Huawei has set a great standard for what a budget phone should be. Extremely high build quality with a clean UI. What else could you ask for? More than adequate performance and outstanding battery life. I have purchased three Huawei phones in the last 3 months (one for each of my two kids) for less than the cost of a high-end flagship. I'm a very discriminating shopper and I can confidently say that I'm extremely pleased with the value and performance of these phones. Well done.,Postif
"I have had this for about a month now, and I love it! Battery lasts a long time, got the Oreo upgrade, works great! Easy to use, etc... No wifi calling, no 5G, but I don't miss it. Also, switching phones from an old Samsung was so easy! Does not come with a bunch of bloatware like my old phone. My wife bought an Iphone 7 at the same time, and I like this much better, and half the price!",Postif
"Former iphone user for many years. I was initially drawn to iphones when smartphones first came on the market and integrated phone, media, and data, and when my employer used to pay for my phone :) Now that my employer does not pay for my phone, and I have to use my own money, I did a ton of research to get the best phone I could in the $200-$250 price point and pair it with a super cheap data provider (ie. went with H20 wireless.. check it out to save more!). The hardest part about switching from an iphone to my Huawei was converting my pre-2009 music downloaded from itunes to a ""universal"" format that could work on my Huawei. I took the easy route, bought a $25 one-year subscription to itunes match to remove all the DRM protection, converted my music, copied it to my Huawei, and I will be cancelling my itunes match subscription soon. (There are other cheaper ways to recover your pre-2009 itunes music, but that's the route I choose since the $25 seemed worth my time. If you have post-2009 music you can simply copy your music without any conversion) I also proved to wife that I could do EVERY SINGLE THING that I formerly could do with my iphone and more, including adding all the extra memory I want with a simple cheap micro card, although I haven't needed one yet given it came with a generous 64GB memory! We have 2 Huawei Mate SEs in the family now, and when my son and daughter eventually need one, I will be pushing to save money and buy these again. Great, great deal!!! Wish I could give it 6 stars.",Postif
"Screen is good quality, battery last a very long time. I don't think and 1 hour to 1.5 is not too bad for a full charge. It updated to Oreo in about 5 mins. It takes great pictures for the price point. The audio is plenty loud both ear and speaker. And it has headphone jack, sadly no type c but that was not a deal breaker for me. Front camera is good as well as rear. It will do split screen. There is NO lag on anything I tired with it. Has awesome signal and the hotspot work's!!! Running it on cricket works perfectly. The phone spying is hogwash... These people make a good quality lasting phone. I'm still using my 2 year old mate 9 and I've not had one issue with it and it still getting updates. Got this model to replace wife's honor 6x phone. All she said was wow this is way better than the old one and really digs the display vs old phone
I will say this they had a super cool phone clone app with each phone it could not have been more easy to swap out the handsets. Scan app from one one to other bingo 30 mins later everything transferred including app data. She literally picked it up and did not have to go through the whole silly process of resetting apps password or relogin in. It even transferred all the text message which surprised me as we both use Textra . No issue. For the money why go buy a 1000 phone when in my opinion this can hang with it. Plus it's dual SIM which give you more storage space for a SD card.",Postif
"I bought this 5 months ago and loved this phone until a couple of days ago the SIM card reader failed and now it cannot send or receive calls or texts. The screen is beautiful, the phone is solid and the right size, the finger reader is superb and super fast, the camera is above average in quality, and the Android OS is quick and the phone has been a delight to use, until now. I have emailed Huaweii to see what response or support they will offer, but this phone should NOT have failed in less than 6 months. I have kept in in a protective case with a tempered glass protective screen cover, and have babied it, never dropped it. If it weren't for the SIM card reader failure, it would be a 5 star item. I have never had a phone that failed before this one.",Negatif
"This review will focus on one of the major complaints that I read here in Amazon reviews both before and after I purchased my Huwai Mate SE. No need to rehash all the stuff that is good about this phone, plenty of other reviews for that but I was having problems with some Apps. But I found the solution so now everything works.

90%-95% of Apps work right out of the box
Over 90% of my Apps worked from the get go, when I set up the phone and imported all the settings from the old phone I was good to go for most of them but there were primarily 2 that did not work right.
1. Mileage tracking App (in my case it was Hurdlr)
2. Call screening/blocking App (My fave didn't work and I downloaded 4 other ones and none of them worked)

The reason these Apps failed is because of Huawei's built in ""feature"" called Protected Apps. You will find it in Settings in the Battery section. You have to make a change in how your phone manages the battery with respect to certain Apps.
In Settings>>Battery there is tab called Launch. Under the heading ""Manage all automatically"" you must turn off the slider for App, which will place the App in the group ""Manage batch manually"". When you go there you will find check boxes now next to your App that you can turn on or off:
Auto Launch
Secondary Launch
Run in background
For my Apps that weren't working before I have all 3 boxes checked and they are working fine now!

I already liked my phone from the appearance, the size how it's large enough yet fits easily in any pocket, how it receives calls all over the house in places where my previous phones could not. But fixing this last issue, certain Apps not doing what they should, takes it over the top and it's clearly a 5 star now especially considering the price.

Update: some common defects people have reported
1. Bluetooth and/or WiFi: I have not had any issue with this at all. My calls are crystal clear in my car. No WiFi problems on 2.4 Ghz.
2. GPS: No issues, I use Waze and Google Maps, both have worked as well or better than on any other phone I have used in the past. My previous phones often had a tendency to get very hot while navigating, the Huawei Mate does not!
3. Camera Quality: Ok,my Sony Xperia had a better camera but it also cost nearly double the price. I don't expect to get a top notch camera at this price point. However, it is more than adequate for my needs. If I need more I will take a camera with me.
4. Battery Life: some have complained about this but my phone lasts for 2 days easily with normal use. If I play with it a lot or do a lot of navigating without it being on charge then it might only go 1.5 days.
5. Reception: the radio on this phone works better than on any other phone I have ever owned. I receive calls in areas of my house where I often wouldn't and I'm experiencing very few call drops even while driving.",Postif
"I had a BLU Advanced 5.0 prior to getting the Huawei Mate SE, and it was a decent starting smartphone. I decided to upgrade to something with more processing power and internal storage. I spent a long time looking at other bargain phones with exceptional quality and features, and I finally chose the Huawei Mate SE.

It's been a great phone. It runs quickly even with a weak signal on my MetroPCS plan. The display is surprisingly good for something that is not a premier phone; even the video and sound compare really well to the iPhone 7 (the choice most of my family prefers).

The camera, although it takes objectively good-looking pictures, produces somewhat grainy macro images, even at short distance, which was something I found slightly disappointing.

However, its battery life is incomparable. I can play music and get GPS directions on the road and still have about forty-percent of battery life by the end of the day.

The 64 GB internal storage is great as well, since it guarantees plenty of storage for pictures and video. The phone runs fairly smoothly when I run three or four apps at once - especially Google Maps, Amazon Music, and the camera (I use the phone as a dash monitor).

If I ever had to get another phone, I'd definitely recommend a Huawei product.",Postif
"I really wanted to like this phone - its characteristics are great and it looks and feels like a higher-end product. However, I could not make a compromise with the quality of the sound. Whether using the phone speaker, or whether placing a regular call, or whether using a car bluetooth device with it, the sound is hollow and sub-par, worse than the sound of any other phone I've owned in the past 5-6 years. I also found the phone screen to be less bright than expected even at higher brightness levels. I've never used Huawei products before and while their EMUI is pretty similar to the standard Android interface, I found it a bit of a downgrade in terms of navigation. The phone also comes with Android 7.0, rather than with 8.0.

On the positive side - the phone makes good pictures in bright daylight and its fingerprint sensor works seamlessly. Its battery life appears good but not phenomenal. I used the phone almost non-stop for about 4 hours (installing software, browsing the net, etc.), during which time its battery level went from about 60% to about 15%.

Overall, the price tag is very attractive, but only if you are willing to make a compromise with the quality of the sound. I am returning the phone because I listen to a lot of music through my cell phone, and need something that sounds good. This Huawei model does not.",Postif
"I waited 2 months before positing this review as i wanted to live with the phone for awhile. I have to say, 2 months in, I love this phone! It has everything I wanted and a great price! You can't beat the screen for this price. It is full HD and perfect. I love the fact my phone just upgraded to the latest Android OS, Oreo 8.0. It has plenty of on board storage and the 4gb ram is all I need! The camera is fine and the battery lasts me for 2 - 3 days! All i can say is it is a lot of value for the price! I am very happy!",Postif
"I did quite a bit of research on different android phones and finally decided the Huawei Mate SE had the most bang for the buck. The 64 GB drive and 4 GB RAM was a major deciding point as well as the compatibility with T-Mobile. I have only had the phone for a few days, but the setup was a breeze transferring from another phone as well as personalizing the phone to my likes. After starting the phone up, the updates to Android 8 were immediate and the enhancements by the update are nice. The Huawei website has a lot of useful information concerning the Mate SE that I found extremely helpful, from camera use as well as other programs and features. I am amazed at the quality of the photos I have taken so far, and realize there is a learning curve, so I am sure they will get better as I use the camera more. I have the camera set for a watermark on photos but is easy to turn it off as well as use other watermarks. The screen resolution is also amazing, videos play smoothly and are crystal clear. Sound quality is not bad, although I tend to use headphones. And the phone and messaging are flawless. All in all, I highly recommend this phone, for the very reasonable price you are getting a high quality phone, and Amazon is great with fast shipping and service.",Postif
"Decent phone. Absolutely not waterproof. Dropped it in the pool with a case on it, removed it within one second of it touching the water, took the cover off and dried it immediately with a towel and in the sun. I had no issues until a day it bugged out on me a bit and finally had no reception. I figured that's my bad but most phones are at least water resistant.. coming from an S5 that I would drop in my water at restaurants as a hat trick and take underwater photos and videos in the ocean with it was very disappointing to see they didn't seal the phone one bit.

I bought a replacement as again I did like the phone and the replacements GPS doesn't work. Very dissatisfied with that as I commute 4 hours daily and use Waze for traffic... Since the phone has no warranty I'm stuck with it... And do I really want to buy another phone? I could have gotten a similar Galaxy phone for the price I've spent so far....",Postif
"This was purchased as a replacement for my broken OnePlus 5T which was a beast of a phone. My 4 star rating is relative to its price, don't compare this to a Samsung S9 or iPhoneX.

Summary: Get this phone to save money, get a large display, and the current design style. Its reasonably good for gaming, watching movies and everything else you want from a smart phone. BUT, as I said, its no iPhoneX or S9.

Pros:
Price  Mate SE $250 vs. $1000 for the cool phones. I've had expensive phones, they're not worth the extra $750 IMO.
Looks  It looks as good as most highend phones.
Battery Life  At 100% charge I start my day at 5:30AM: Gaming 1hr, Youtube for 1hr, GPS track my jog 1hr, google maps, web browse for an entire day and still have maybe 15% by bed time at 11pm.
Weight  Its light for its size
Screen Resolution  FHD+ | 2160 x 1080 ... It's not QHD, but anyone who says they can tell the difference on a 6"" screen must have superhuman eyes.

Cons:
WiFi  Connects to 2G not 5G for me. Thats ok, still plenty fast.
NFC  No NFC. That's ok for me.
USB  Uses old school Micro USB vs. USB-C. This is good and bad.
Charge Time  1% between 1.5 minutes to 2 minutes. SLOW.
UI  Example: Accessing the camera options is confusing.
Crashes often when I have Youtube playing in the background but not when I'm actively watching.

Its a phone made in China, so it may be spying on me and sending my data back to the Chinese Government. But that's ok, I'm not looking at anything worth their time and most likely you aren't either.",Postif
"After several years of purchasing top tier phones, I got tired of spending that kind of money on a PHONE. Spending around 1K to make phone calls, check email, IG, surf, and watch the occasional Youtube video is ludicrous.

Coming from a Galaxy Note 6, I wasn't prepared to be impressed at this price point, but I am.

Pros:

Price point - I mean, seriously.
Size - great to hold. Slim and the 18:9 screen makes the shape comfortable.
Quick - the processor is quite quick and 4GB of RAM is nice.
Less uninstallable software than carrier branded phones
Unlocked
Fingerprint reader - wow is this thing FAST. Love it.

Cons:

Screen - definitely not AMOLED which is what I'm used to. This is the biggest drawback, but I understand that it would have upped the price a bit. However, I would have paid the difference. Some things look a little washed out with little depth to photos, etc.
LED notification - wow is this thing TINY and not bright at all. I wind up checking my phone more often when in silent or vibration mode. My Note had a nice bright LED which I customized the color per application.
Charging port - no USB C. Maybe next time.

This is from about 1 week's worth of use, so I plan on updating on reliability in a few months.",Postif
I am give it a 2 stars because the phone keep deleting my WhatsApp application conversation. This doesn't make me happy. I am a businessman and converse with a lot of people through WhatsApp. This is important for me to be able to retain my conversation history. This remind me what a customer and I discussed about in the past. I bought the HONOR 5x I changed it after 2 says just because of that. Now I realize the HUAWEI SE is doing the same thing.... Deleting all my saved contacts and conversations. I am very disappointed with this phone. I has a galaxy phone and other phone never had to endure that problem.,Negatif
"I have bought several phones to use to play Pokemon Go game. I had to return several for various reasons such as bad battery, non working GPS, of inablity to access the SM card. This phone was in the middle price range of the phones I bought to try out. Initially this phone seemed like it would be adequate for such a purpose. although it seemed slower than other phones that cost the same or less. The display was poorer than other phones I used that cost the same or less but adequate although it often required increasing brightness to be visible. But now it has developed an instability that makes it unusable for playing the game as it won't hold the balls steady anymore that one needs to throw to play the game. Other aspects of the game still seem OK. The wi-fi seems good most of the time. I haven't used it for regular phone calls as my poor hearing make it unusable for phone calls as speakers are much weaker than my older ZTE phones that were half the price. Text messages seem OK as does internet browsing.",Negatif
"I love my new phone, and have not had too steep a learning curve to use it. It's attractive and works really well. It takes great pictures, and easily does all that it should. The case I bought is pretty slippery and so I drop it a lot, so I may return to the clear case that came with it, which is really nice, actually. (I hadn't realize it came with one until I accidentally looked under stuff in the box). The only thing I don't like about it is a factory sticker on the phone at the bottom that doesn't look too bad, but I wish they would have not put it on there. (It's small and silvery, so not super ugly, but with a clear case it's not my fave thing to have on there.) One strange thing to me is that the sound comes out at the bottom instead of the top, I think, but it's not bad. Great phone overall, and I like it a lot. It's much better than the last phone I had!",Postif
"Everything is true to description and more. The phone arrived in a nice little box, with charger and clear phone case. No screen protector. The color is gold.

I was skeptical due to the reviews being mixed (which are mostly positive and supposedly Amazon's pick)...we took a risk and went for it. So glad we did and very pleased with the purchase. The phone is extremely beautiful, sleek and fast. Boy is it fast! So many phones malfunctioning in the past for us and having to return them all, this one is flawless so far. 2 weeks going strong. I'm quite jealous now that we got this for my boyfriend, I want one now to replace my LG Stylus 2 Plus (and it's a decent phone).

A heads up to anyone looking to buy this phone, please be aware that it only takes nano SIM card. Meaning, the smallest size SIM card. Micro SIM will not fit. Had to go buy a SIM card kit at Walmart which cost $56 in order to switch phone number & plan over to the new sim.

The phone is very nice. Got a few compliments on it. I would recommend a good bulky case because it feels so slim and fragile in hand or pocket. Speakers are good, screen resolution is off the wall. Fantastic camera with very good pictures. I'm not even joking. You won't regret this gem. It's an awesome phone.",Postif
"Hello this review is about the Huawei SE 5.93 now this is exactly what the phone is really like , it is a 5.7'' and not 5.9 much smaller than what is advertise on Amazon or Amazon say it is A 5.7'' please be advise the PH is 5.7'' I measure IT and did a comparison with an LG 5.7'' Even the case fit both Phones of a 5.7'' from different Companies ??? .
Plus this phone is not at all as wide as regular phones it is slimmer than most phones i ever had or used !!!

MOTO X PURE EDITION and the Huawei the LG is the same size as the Huawei mate SE 5.93'' I OWN the LG and Moto- x PURE Edition all is 5.7'' but both the LG an Moto - X Is wider .................... On the positive side the Hauwei seems a better Quality Phone over all buy with confident now you all know the phone is like have lots of space Smooth To The Touch very nice Phone just not what is advertise as far as the size only . the phone really have all that is advertise 4GB RAMS MEMORY , 64 GB ROM STORAGE Good phone will buy again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!............",Postif
"Edit #1 (11/6/18) 6 months in and this phone is still going STRONG! The thing is still as fast as the day I pulled it out of the box and has aged very well. I've had it in a case with a glass screen protector since day one and the phone still looks brand new. I've recommended this budget phone to everyone I possibly can. It's well worth the money.

Phone has what matters where it matters. The biggest things it lacks is USB-C and NFC. Other than that it's a SOLID phone. It has a great processor and plenty of memory. It feels great in the hand and doesn't feel cheap. Flagship phones last 2-3 years. With this pricing I can buy a budget phone every year and throw the old one away and it will still be cheaper than buying a flagship phone every 2-3 years.",Postif
"This is a very good phone - fast, excellent software and hardware.
Easy to transfer settings and contents from my old phone.
Work with TMobile network after I moved my sim over from my old phone.
This also comes with a very nice soft transparent protection cover - No need to buy one.",Postif
"I bought this phone for my sister a few months ago and she loved it. Just had another family member looking for a new phone. I saw this same phone on sale and recommended it to them.

The phone itself is definitely not a flagship phone but for a mid range priced phone, it's not bad at all. My sister plays games on this phone and didn't have any complaints. The family member I'm buying this for is definitely not a gamer and only uses it for lighter tasks.

He previously owned an LG G6 and this phone was a bit heftier in weight and the screen size was also larger on the Huawei Mate SE. The response times are pretty good most of the times. I noticed slight lags once in a while but nothing too bad. Setup was simple and we were asked if we wanted to bring our data and apps over from the previous phone. It's done using the Google account so apps can be automatically downloaded back to the new phone. The phone downloaded about 20+ apps and were were on our way using it shortly afterward. The apps were responsive and we didn't notice any lags.

The phone came with a cable, charger and case. The case is the slim TPU type which won't offer much protection if you drop it. All the buttons and ports were accessible so that won't be a problem for those who are more careful and prefer to use a slimmer see-through case.

We took some pictures and the quality were not bad at all. Definitely not photographers here but we mainly use the phone for taking pictures on the go or on vacations. The phone pictures quality are pretty good these days so we usually don't need to have a separate higher quality camera on hand.

The audio from the phone is pretty clear when we played back videos and made phones calls. No issues so far.

Overall, glad with purchasing this phone again at a good price. It's perfect for anyone who doesn't need to use any app/game that consumes a lot of CPU and memory. There's no problem playing most of the games and I know my sister plays a handful of games on her phone.",Postif
"I got this phone to replace my aging Blu Life One X. I'm mostly happy with it, but there are some issues with default settings that could stand to be a little more user friendly.

The most egregious example is with the default music player, and how Huawei really, really expects you to use it, whether you want to or not. Apps also (by default) don't keep running after the screen locks, which is kind of a pain in the ass if you just want music while you're driving, or cooking dinner, or if you hate yourself and decide to go jogging. You have to really play around with power, permission, launch, and cache settings to use play store apps in place of the OEM stuff. I should note that my phone updated to Android 8 the day I got it, so I never got the chance to see if it was the same on Nougat.

Hardware-wise, it's easily the best phone I've ever owned. The screen is lovely, there's a generous supply of ram, and I didn't even really need the extra micro SD storage space. I don't have anything to compare the fingerprint reader to, but it seems fast enough. A solid buy for $230.",Postif
"Love this phone. Works flawless on metro by TMobile in NY after calling and adding IMEI to account. Great 4g LTE speed. Camera is good, sound is great...Huawei is an awesome brand with great products This phones feels like a high-end device with amid-range price...fast, snappy, lots of space and ram, fast cpu.. ignore that Chinese spying on you nonsense. Will be sticking with this brand, tired of the insane price gouging going on in the US mobile phone market. $1000.00 for a phone...gimme a break lol.",Postif
"I really like this phone but it is starting to come apart in the lower left corner.

After talking with Huawei support I learned that a simple 1 foot drop onto carpet will void the warranty if you have any damage that can be assessed as physical damge. Now I have a phone that was in a case to protect it and slipped off the couch, that has a screen separating from the case and they will not repair or replace it. I am not happy with this at all. I have had other phones endure much more drops and they were still covered. I can't believe a company would want to make this right.",Postif
"I love this phone. I purchased my first HUAWEI when my Samsung Galaxy Note crapped out after only a couple of years. I wasn't willing to pay the exorbitant price for another Samsung flagship. So I bought a Huawei Honor 6x. So when my husband's phone died, he took over using the Honor 6x and I bought this one.

The memory is great. The fact that it has ability to have a memory card inserted is great. The photo quality are crisp and clear. I was able to connect it to my carrier (StraightTalk) by just inserting the SIM card is definitely a big plus. I love everything about the phone except for the screen.

I read a lot on my phone and I also use it to write notes to myself when I'm away from my computer. The touch screen is not anywhere nearly as responsive as the Honor 6x. And if you add a screen protector, it is horrible. Touching anything near the edges of the screen involves repeated touching, sometimes pounding keys on the virtual keyboard (when I get frustrated). I have given up on using screen protectors for that reason. I now live with the fear I will drop the phone and the screen will crack. And I am so frustrated at times, that I consider finding a different phone.

This is the only reason I've given it the number of stars I have. And had the screen been as peppy as the Honor 6x is, I'd have given it five stars",Postif
"Likes:
Photos of front facing camera are very good to excellent quality.
Very good battery life, i.e., usually more than 1 day, i.e., 1 to 2 days, even with heavy use.
Quick start up
Little to no bloat-ware if you buy an unlocked phone and insert SIM card from a vendor
Instant fingerprint recognition to make security an ease
Good size, i.e., decent screen and still fits easily in pocket
Affordable

Dislikes:

SERIOUS LIMITATION: The major problem I have with this otherwise very decent smart phone, is that the contact information only allows searches on names, titles, and organization fields. A search on contact information using a Samsung phone would generate a search on ALL contact fields. So for example, if you wish to search your contacts for people or companies you know in Chicago or Denver, you can't do it with the Huawei Mate SE. If you used the ""Note"" field in contacts to indicate friends or businesses who participate in various activities like SCUBA, Skiing, etc., or perhaps you use the Note field to indicate contacts who provide resources for your mother or other family member, searching Huawei Mate SE contacts for ""SCUBA"" or ""Skiing"" or ""Mom"", will NOT bring up any information. Furthermore, if you search Huawei Mate SE for the string ""MD"", it will bring up contacts with MD listed as their title, but it will also bring up irrelevant names and organizations which contain the letters M...D, such as Mary Dorney and Mark David. So whereas Samsung ""Makes it possible"" to search contacts for relevant and useful information other than name and organization, unfortunately Huawei ""Makes it IMPOSSIBLE"" to search contacts for such information.

Other dislikes include:
Rear facing (selfie) camera takes poor quality photos.
Camera HDR mode seems to have little to no impact on photos.

If it wasn't for the serious limitation on searching contacts, I probably would have rated the Mate SE a 5.",Postif
"Firstly, I came from and LG G5 and used an battery case that gave me an additional 150% charge. So, with basically 250% battery my phone would barely last 20 hours total, all I really did was play music from my music player while I worked. Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy 5, that battery was better but still lacking. This phone gets me through an 8-10 hour shift of constant music streaming from Tunein radio with about 60% left on the battery. Just incredible. Now, for some reason my sd card kept coming back as malfunctioning and my music on that would not play. Nothing that the app Poweramp did not fix on that end. The camera itself isn't that great, but serviceable. The speaker isn't overly loud, either. But for me these weren't big concerns for me. The phone is excellent overall, and the price is very low for what it could be. I did buy mine on sale for $219. Very happy with this device.",Postif
"Great Phone! Updated to Oreo with no hiccups. Cloned my old phone and transferred all my data and apps without any hiccups. The phone is so customizable and intuitive. I upgraded to this phone from a LG stylo 3 and it blows rings around that phone. My only gripe is the camera, under certain lighting conditions it can be a little washed out, but you can always tweak the settings to clean up the image. I have been recommended this phone to anyone who will listen. If this phone lasts for more than a year without any major problems, Huawei has a customer for life.

And unless you're working for the military or government,I wouldn't be too concerned with the Chinese hacking your phone. If Huawei is able to move forward and put this behind them, I see them as a formidable competitor in this arena.",Postif
"It's a great phone for the price. I was looking for replacement for my Moto (battery dying slowly). Moto g6, Nokia 6.1 and this one were the options, I choose Mate just to try something new. I'm not regreting it.
Body quality is great, I like slim design and material quality. Shape it great, despite a big diagonal for my taste it doesn't feel big in hand.
Screen it bright, angles are ok. It's fast. Immidiatelly after getting online it grabed Oreo update.
Battery it good, 2 days without problems with normal usage, location and BT are constantly on. Old USB port is convinient if you have stock of old chargers.
The only downside noticed so far is luck of fast charge. While overall charging time is average, about 2 hours it's linear function of time, which can be a problem if you forget about it in the morning and need to run fast.
Camera is average, while portrait mode is good. Also spent some time removing rubbish preinstalled apps.
Overall its a great phone, I would buy it again.",Postif
"I had a bad experience with the purchase of an s8+ recently and just wanted to get an affordable phone with decent specs. Came across this phone, the reviews seemed good. I have not been disappointed. Been using it about 2 months now, and it is a great phone. Battery life is great, phone is snappy, more than enough RAM, and added a 128GB sd card to it for plenty storage. It has one minor issue however, and that is the bluetooh. It can be a little dodgy, especially when switching between calls and streaming music. The bluetooth also slows down the WiFi speed, because it shares an antenna.

That being said, the bluetooth issue is not enough to lose a star, because the phone itself is solid.",Postif
"With a small budget, I was looking for something good and reliable and it seems AMAZING for the price! Having two sim-cards ports, excellent camera, works fast (which is very crucial for me), plenty of storage and a big and bright screen!
The screen also can be divided into two screen which is pretty cool if you wanna do two things at the same time. On the overall, the phone has really cool features. Probably the only cons in that the sound is not amazing, but I can totally live with it, and another downside is that it is very hard to find accessories for the device, as of now, there are none screen-protectors that are suitable. I eventually managed to find a good hard case for the device. Great value for money, Huawei and Amazon offered me a great service when I ran with problems when I got the first device and completely refunded me and I was able to get a new one.
Very recommended device!",Postif
"I love this phone and was very excited to see what it could do. So many functions at a great price. I wish it could have worked with my service provider. I was able to activate it easily, but where I lived I could not receive or make calls. When I was out and about it worked perfectly. Unfortunately because I am a stay at home dad to a 3 year old, I had to return it for safety purposes. If something should happen, I had no way to make a call out for help. It just happened to be where I live is a gsm nightmare. Hated to return it and settle for a phone without all the great features of this huawei mate.",Postif
"Has fingerprint unlocking/ID, the voice to text works great, it has dual sim for extra space and it works great. Keep in mind that this phone is not compatible with icloud so it does not get .mac or .icloud email unless you go to the icloud website, log in and then access your (miniature) email. Takes a little time to get used to the answering interface but I'm not great at using cell phones anyway, so there's that... However, the phone does *everything* that more expensive phones do and at an amazing price... and if I lose this phone or it gets stolen I'll be sad -- but not as sad as if I lost an $800 phone!",Postif
"I've only had this phone for a few days and I only have positive things to say about it. The 5.93"" 18:9 screen has a slimmer, and easier to hold, body than my previous phone that had a smaller screen size. The screen resolution is stunning with vibrant colors. The octacore processor is way faster than my ex-phone's quad. The camera is fast and takes amazing pictures. The sound is generic but not bad. The battery life is good, I had 40% after 10hours of moderate use. The price went down by $20 a few days after I bought it but I'm so happy with this phone I just can't complain. BTW, did I mention this came loaded with 64Gb memory!",Postif
"Hello. I purchased this phone May 1 2018 to replace an old note 4.

Major issues:
1. This phone has some bad GPS tech. I use my phone for hiking and car navigation since google maps is more accurate than my garmin navigation at times. In my city, my phone will constantly drop gps signal (searching for GPS signal). I am forced to add my garmin navigation as well because my phone will lose signal like 20 times. I took this phone too the woods many times and had countless issues locating my position.

2. The touch screen is bad as others have claimed. Sometimes you must double touch in order for something on the side of the screen to be activated. My old note 4 ironically had a much better screen and it did not suffer from this, even though it was an insanely old phone.

Conclusion: I have no issues with anything else, however the GPS thing makes this device a total waste of money. I regret not waiting for a drop of other competitive android products that are pricier. You live and learn. Save your money and go for their android competition.",Negatif
"This phone was a step down in terms of display size from my Ascend Mate 2. I was, frankly, a bit underwhelmed when I received it.

However having used it for a day or two, I realized that it is a gorgeous phone with an amazing screen and some really cool features having Android 8.0. Huawei includes a cover or case to use with the phone which I have found to be extremely helpful as well. The actual phone looks super nice compared to most of the videos and most of the images you can find on the web. Highly recommend!

Cons: Occasional lag.",Postif
"WOW! I took a very long time to research various phones to see what I could get that was within my budget, had really good specs, and was at least close to one thing I REALLY wanted, which was a 6"" phone. This one is 5.93"" The specs are fantastic. It works perfectly, and the customer service that Huawei provides is second to none. Very speedy, no delay in anything I've done. Takes nice pictures (I was not looking for ""the best"" pictures - I just wanted something that produced good ones). I really can't say enough good things about it. I'll be looking at Huawei first the next time I need a phone.",Postif
"I'm glad I checked the reviews on this Huawei Mate SE. This phone is fast, has beautiful graphics, easy to set up, well made and is the OS is updatable to 8.0. The Moto phones that have an Amazon OS variant have not got an upgrade to the latest OS. I love my Huawei! This phone is well worth the purchase. It doesn't have the Amazon bloatware either....nice! This phone also has a much more stable and lasting internet connection than my Moto G5 Plus. I've been able to use my Huawei Mate SE in the weak signal spots in my home...better than the Moto G5 Plus.",Postif
"Recently, my wife decided to drown her Samsung Galaxy 5 and this phone was purchased, by me, as a replacement. She has had it almost 3 weeks now and does not have any negatives to say about it. In fact, all she says is, ""I love it!"" She runs a lot of apps so her first love is its battery which she now can get by with a daily charge. Second, she loves the camera. Third, is the screen resolution and size and finally, it the ease of operation with the Android OS. She was a bit concerned that the phone's physical size might be excessive but now she adores it. Oh, she also said that the phone only has 2 buttons, volume and on/off and both buttons actually required a good push to make contact unlike the Samsung which, annoyingly, needing nothing more than a mere breath. The more she continues to heap praise on this phone, the more I am considering buying one for myself come Christmas. All-in-all, great phone, great price!",Postif
"I noticed a difference between this and other smart phones out of the box. I especially like that I can completely uninstall bloatware and that apps like Facebook aren't system installments / requirements. The screen is crystal clear and resists fingerprint buildup. The phone's processing speed is incredible. No lagging. Just an incredibly beautiful, high performing choice. The price point could double and the phone would be worth it, though perhaps not morally. Economic accessibility without minimizing features. Yes. Can't say enough good things so one con: those terms that must be agreed to before operating the phone are a little scary, but make me wonder what's going on behind the scenes of phones that don't make us aware of their software and data practices.",Postif
"Great phone, I got it to replace my Huawei honor 5x that I had for a few years. This phone is really snappy, and sleek looking too. It kinda looks like an iPhone 7, which is nice because I always liked their design but never wanted to spend the money on one, so this was the perfect choice for me. The storage space is amazing, on my 5x I couldn't even update my apps anymore for lack of space. Now I have all my apps and still have 46gb left, not to mention the SD card slot for extra space. I only wish they had it in blue like the 7x. It was a tough choice between the two for me because the 7x has the awesome blue, as well as the facial recognition. But the mate se has double the storage and an extra gb of RAM for $30 more. Not to mention the se is also getting an update for facial recognition. I did get a blue slim case so I can pretend my phone is blue. FYI the tudia tamm case is very nice, it keeps the phone slim without extra bulk, but also makes it feel protected. The tempered glass for this phone are awful, none of them seem to stick because of the curved edge on the screen. I did purchase the super shields tempered glass, since they have the best rating with a whopping 3 1/2 stars, but fingers crossed it doesn't pop off.",Postif
"I should have bought this long ago if I knew. This phone is so good that I had to buy one for my phone after I used mine for just a month.
I used to have network issue in my house with my HTC MORE but I have full signal in the same house and on the same career on this phone.

Internet, Bluetooth and everything is great.
Voice mail and everything is working.
NOTE: phone doesn't have infrared so you can't install remote on it but you can do that through the internet. You will need an adapter.",Postif
"For a $250 phone I can't complain at all!!! More storage , ram, and reliability than my Iphone 6 I was using at a fraction of the cost. Took this to Europe for a trip with a seigen case and a wrist grip.com strap and it was great for monument photos and hard to be snatched by passerbys! I've attached a few excellent photos I took with it. Love this phone!",Postif
"Well I just got the phone yesterday 12/14 I didn't set it up until today 12/15. I inserted my sim card the phone needed to ""format sim"" and now my sim card doesn't work on the new phone or my old phone. So for tonight I have no phone. Needless to say I am not at all happy with my purchase. I am strongly considering returning this phone.

***Update I am not as smart as I thought I was**"" I tried to enter the scan disk memory card instead of the nano SIM card. The phone is working now. I still think the phone feels like cheap plastic, but I need some time to see what I really think. Will review again in a couple weeks.",Postif
"I've been using this phone for around 6 months and it's easily the best phone I've had.

Build Quality-
The build of the phone is solid and has some weight to it. Granted I have a case on it, I've dropped it a couple times and not a mark on it. The touch sensor located in the upper middle on the backside is a good location and easy to reach, works very well.

Screen-
While not a 4k screen, it's full HD and looks incredibly sharp. The colors look very sharp, and you're able to change the color temp in the settings which is a nice touch.

Speakers-
While only one on the bottom right side, they're fairly loud and sound pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but they get the job done.

Cameras-
This is where the sacrifices were surely made. In low light, the camera quality is pretty bad. In normal lighting they're OK, so if you're keen on photography you'd be better off looking elsewhere.

Battery -
This is a huge thing for me since I'm a heavy user. I'm always streaming music, watching videos or surfing the web. The battery easily lasts me the day, 12-15 hours, with 40% left to boot. In the off chance you need it, there's the standard battery saver, and the very handy ultra power saving mode at 10% that puts up a black screen with only the bare necessity apps for communication.

Performance-
This phone is no slouch, it's incredibly fast for the regular tasks. It can multitask very well without any hiccups. As for gaming, I'm not too keen on mobile gaming but I imagine this can handle most apps you throw at it. For a visual spectacle this might not be an ideal phone for you, but that's up to testing.

I'm very happy with my purchase!",Postif
"This phone is a vast improvement over the more expensive LG phone I had before. I had been cussing my service provider for no service in certain areas on the old phone, but now there is service where those cuss words hung in the air. I don't use the camera very much, but I have taken a couple of really good pictures with it, one portrait and one landscape. Physically the phone is very solid, and survived a couple of drops with the included case, and a purchased screen protector. It has a large bright screen, and does not come loaded with crapware, although Google manages to sneak some in. Note that this is a GSM phone, only valid for ATT and T-Mobile in the US, and in all the rest of the world. I managed, with very little help from my service provider, to make the transition from my old phone.",Postif
"I was looking for a smartphone that if I dropped in the toilet I wouldn't be too upset over, but I wanted large size because I am a large man. So I wasn't going to pay for an iPhone or Samsung, and didn't want to spend more than a few hundred dollars. I have been a customer of TracFone for years, and I knew they have a Bring Your Own Phone program. I saw this phone at Walmart under an AT&T subscription. So I did a little research and figured out that buying a factory unlocked phone and a TracFone AT&T SIM card would suit my needs. I purchased both from Amazon, and went about the set up when they arrived. As soon as I turned the phone on, it began auto updating it's software and apps. This took the better part of 20 hours! They only real issue I had was that altho I used Tracfone's website to activate the SIM, it didn't happen. After 3 days of no service, I went to the TracFone's website and used the Chat feature with an associate. The SIM activated and the number ported in about a half hour. BINGO and Win Win!

Since I began using this phone in late July, twice I have gotten automated calls from AT&T to verify the account. First it asks for the last four of my social security number, which I typed in. Then it asked for my AT&T account number. At this point I did not enter any number. After asking twice more, the computer gave up and said Thank You! I never lost service.
As to the phone it is really very good! Altho like all Android phones I've had it doesn't allow you to completely delete unwanted apps, or move them to the SD card memory, it does have the ability to stop updating the apps you don't want and thus save the phone's memory.
The SD micro card and the SIM both live in a pop-out tray. If you travel internationally, this feature theoretically allows you to obtain a SIM card in the place you are visiting pop it into your phone and you are ready to go.
Other reviews have panned the camera quality in low light on this phone. I can't say I've done enough pics on it to notice, but I was buying a phone, not a camera.
All in all I heavily recommend this phone and the TracFone system to anyone looking to purchase a larger smartphone for 25% of what an iPhone or Samsung costs.",Postif
"I'm a mobile electronics installer and one of the big things today is using your mobile to play music in your vehicle, which Android Auto compatible radios are designed to do. Sadly, Huawei phones do not work with Car Play. I think there should be a big notice in the description NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANDROID CAR PLAY.

Huawei needs to stop being lazy and fix this. I would not have purchased this phone had I known this. Otherwise, I'd have given it 5 stars.",Postif
Awesome smart phone! Upgraded from the Honor 5x and the difference is significant and noticable. Considered the 7x but the Mate SE provided the extra RAM. Glad I made the switch and I would highly recommend!,Postif
"After months of researching a new phone I finally decided on this one. It has met all of my needs and beyond. Quality is top notch, screen is beautiful, plenty of storage space, smooth OS and the camera is spectacular(added some pics to review). I'm extremely happy with this purchase!

Only issue is you cannot play audio externally via an auxiliary cable. I purchased a Bluetooth adapter for my car though and that solved the problem.",Postif
This phone is absolutely a great choice. They call this a budget cellphone? The Huawei Mate SE is solid and well made. It's made better than most expensive cellphones. The screen is crystal clear and vibrant. The bluetooth and call quality is excellent on AT&T's network. So many great features to name on here. I rate it an A+ in my opinion. My only con is the battery probably won't last you all day if you're a heavy user like myself. Charging the Huawei Mate SE is pretty quick though. The Huawei Mate SE is another winner at a reasonable price!,Postif
"Having been an iphone user for the past 10 years, I have to say this is easily the best phone I've ever owned. The display is simply stunning, the battery lasts forever, apps run very fast and smooth. The battery lasts days on a single charge.
I especially love the selfie cam, it performs amazingly well in low light environments. My understanding is that when you take a selfie with it, it actually takes a bunch of pics behind the scene and use AI to select the one that looks best. I know it's weird but I always get the most natural facial expression when I take pics with this phone.
Overall, I think this phone feels even more premium than iPhone X. The only thing that bothers me a little is the lack of apple's iMessage. But if you are an android fan, this is a very solid choice.",Postif
"I've had this phone for one week so far. It arrived with a hairline crack, but I had to use it as my other phone was not functioning. I've ordered a replacement so hopefully it goes well with return. My review is based on the phones performance, not this crack. AT&T. It works perfectly. The camera is excellent in good lighting. Low light it lacks but for the price I certainly can't complain. The fingerprint sensor is lightning fast. It's fast. Has plenty of storage, which is expandable with the SD card. Buy this phone.",Postif
"This phone is amazing I love it,the battery life is really good been using it for 4 days now . Awesome ??????????",Postif
"I am usually a Samsung shoper, I decided to make the switch because I was tired of the high phone payments and the plan payments. So when time came to buy a new phone, I decided to buy a budget phone, I was expecting a downgrade but I so no difference quite the opposite, this was better than the expensive samsungs. The battery life is great, I didn't have to charge it everynight, unless I play video games with it :) ... The useability is awesome very slick and fast processor and the price is where I need it to be. My wife says that pic quality is much better on Samsung but for that price I am fine with this.",Postif
"I got sick of paying for OVERPRICED cell phones. My 6 month search for the best budget phone is now complete. In fact I am blown away by the features this phone has... Huge 6 inch screen, amazing battery life, 8 core CPU, 64 GB storage, 4GB memory, super fast finger print reader, FACE UNLOCK ID, Android 8.0, aluminum construction! Dual SIM card slot, expandable storage, camera is pretty decent. All for only $229 Goodbye Apple and Samsung....

I haven't noticed many issues, sound quality is okay, not paying high price so I didn't expect much. Not waterproof, never owned a waterproof phone so I don't care much about that feature.",Postif
"This phone has massive storage. I recently owned a Samsung 5 and it feels great to be able to put any app I want on it without deleting another. The sound the speaker gives off is loud and clear as well. I had the phone next to my portable speaker and I thought my portable was on and it wasn't. Camera works great as well. Way better than my Samsung 5. Since that was my last phone that's all I can compare it to. Update to Android 8 was very easy because it prompted me to do so, pretty much just a tap away. I would recommend this phone to anyone who hates contracts and wants a lot storage while having a solid camera. Only 2 dislikes for me. 1. The speaker phone itself isn't as loud as my Samsung was even though playing music and watching videos blows it away. 2. I have to hit the back button to remove the keyboard while using messenger. This just means I have to hit back 2x to get out of anything I'm typing. Kind of a plus and minus because sometimes when you want the keyboard to go away on a Samsung 5 its difficult, at least for me.",Postif
"This is a beautiful, powerful, amazing smartphone, with similar or better quality than phones of several times of price. Long lasting battery, super performance, great pictures, comfortable design and touch. Phone is cool while playing videos. Setup is so easy. Dual Sim. PERFECT size. Fingerprint unlocking works flawlessly. The only drawback in my opinion is that the battery is built into the phone and may be hard to be exchanged by the consumer. This phone is a great addition to the US phone market for consumers to choose.",Postif
"Seems to be running faster and better than Nuu G3. I like small,4 inch phones which are probably no longer available. Even thou it says 18:9 aspect ratio, they must mean the viewing screen and not what is actually in your hand. Nuu G3 is smaller width wise. Mate SE has pretty much the same width compared to HTC Desire eye from 2 years ago. The glass is curved on the side much like Galaxy S9. So a glass screen protector could have problems with the sides. Original clear silicone case that came with phone protects the glass screen when you place it glass down on a surface. Doesn't have a color reverse, which turns white into black when using it at night. But then every color gets reversed.",Postif
"I've been using this phone for the past few weeks and I can't say anything bad about it. Big screen, fast processor, enough RAM and an SD card expansion slot to store plenty of music and video files. The speaker is loud enough and the battery lasts for a long time.
Keep in mind that this is a $230 phone so you will not get all the bells and whistles that other expensive brands have. Personally, I don't care about those extra features because I don't use them anyway. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",Postif
"The Huawei Mate SE is the best budget phone I've ever purchased. For $229 is was an absolute steal. The phone arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. Everything about it says high quality. The free case they throw in is good quality, fits well, and looks nice. The build quality on this phone looks nice and is very solid. That being said the phone is very light and feels good in the hand. The screen quality of the display is also very nice and it gets very bright in direct sunlight for easy readability. The operating system is filled with options and is not limited like other budget devices. Sound quality is very good and call quality is excellent. On T-Mobile I have had less calls drop then on the Moto Z2 Force which was purchased through T-Mobile. WiFi works extremely well even without the ability to use 5G WiFi. Overall, I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a great budget device or primary device at a great price. This is my new daily driver.",Postif
"If you're looking for a new Android phone and don't want to pay the ridiculous prices for a Samsung or LG or all the others charge, this might be a good option for you. But be advised, the camera / picture quality is not great compared to an iPhone 7 / iPhone 8 or Samsung. I did a comparison this weekend at my son's football game and this phone does not measure up to the quality and resolution that even my old 2014 Motorola Nexus 6 offered. The pictures are OK but not great. You might want to spend a little more to get a better camera section if pictures are a top priority. Everything else on the phone is great. A+ lightweight, nice touch screen, runs fast and has plenty of storage. Overall Rating is 4 stars.",Postif
"Great phone, everything works and now with Oreo it runs even smoother. Multitasking( nav in small window while I browse home) and split windows work smoothly. I had honor 5x prior to this phone and I am quite happy with the purchase. I play emulators for the psone and psp in this phone. Works great so far only psp games have some sound and lag issues now and then.",Postif
"I've only ever had cheap phones, and this too can be considered a cheap phone by some, but the quality is outstanding. I love the fingerprint sensor feature and the large screen. It also runs many apps without lagging and the battery seems to last forever which is surprising since I seem to be on my phone 24/7. The picture quality is still very good -not $1000 iPhone quality- but it has a multitude of cool filters to choose from. It is also not exactly a device I would play music on without headphones because the sound is tinny. I bought a wallet case and a screen protector for this phone. The screen protector may make the screen a little less sensitive, and it is also sometimes hard to unlock the phone via fingerprint because of the case, but I find that these add ons make using this phone more convenient overall.",Postif
I set this up to wake up the phone or answer calls using the finger print scanner. It works every time! Display is beautiful and responsive. My wife and I both have Huawei phones and love them. Great bang for your buck.,Postif
"Best budget phone in my opinion. Got to try this for half a day when it was sent after cancelling my order.(waiting for the Huawei View).
As with other reviewers, this is smooth as butter, fast, and just beautiful. I read issues about the wifi slowing down when using bluetooth , which I confirmed to be true, but not that bad compared to my Note 5 which slows down too when using both. If not for the upcoming release of the other Mate 10 Pro variant, I would have kept this one. If the ""View"" won't impress me, I might just reorder this one again.",Postif
"Very affordable phone with big screen and fast processor. I don't play games on my phone, but it's got more than enough juice to handle Netflix and Youtube. The call quality is great. The fingerprint sensor on the back is very fast. The only negative is that I could do more with the fingerprint sensor on my old Honor 5. On my old phone, I could launch different apps using different fingerprints, so that made it very convenient to make calls and play music on the fly. This phone doesn't seem to offer this function, otherwise it would be a 5-star rating.",Postif
"This is a pretty good Android phone. The fingertip lock is in a weird place, on the back of the phone, but after a while you get used to that. My big beef with this phone is that, no matter what I try, the sound for an incoming text message is so faint as to be almost indeciperable. And when you're waiting for a text, that is an important feature. My late iPhone had a nice clear bell tone that was easy to hear, but this phone just doesn't seem to have the capacity for a loud text alert. If anyone else has solved this problem, I'd love to hear about it. Otherwise, I'm happy with itl",Postif
"Love this phone! I have had it for several months. This is the first non flagship phone that I have owned. The only thing it is missing is NFC, which I don't use anyway. Bloatware is almost non existent. User interface is smooth. Phone is plenty powerful. Camera is acceptable. The phone is a nice size. The screen, while not OLED, is of solid quality. I love that it has a micro SD card slot, although if we are being honest, is not as big of a deal as it once was. My experience with this phone has been so positive that my Sister and Dad have both purchased one too. Solid purchase.",Postif
"Display Screen dimming frequently very annoying. Huawei technical support unable to troubleshoot on the phone and recommended I send in the phone, I had for only four days, for repair or replacement. Multiple Huawei web complaints indicated that display dimming and flickering is a known problem with many Huawei phone models. Phone returned.",Negatif
I chose to switch to the Huawei mate se after a TON of research. I've had it alitte over 7 months now and couldn't be happier. The battery life is amazing. The picture quality it amazing. The price is amazing. The phone itself is amazing! This is the brand I will chose from now on. I switched from an iPhone and will never go back or buy a phone over $300 again.,Postif
I've only had this phone for 2 weeks but I couldn't be more pleased. I bought this phone to replace the Oukitel Ok6000 which I had for about two weeks and dropped from about a foot and the screen cracked and I'm happy it did because then I bought this phone which was supposed to be my work phone but I have since switched the SIM cards and made this my primary phone and made my Samsung Galaxy s9($950) my secondary phone. In my opinion this phone is better than the Samsung and for $700 less if I had only known. The only question left for me is will it last and I would guess that it will being it appears to be well made with quality materials. I would definitely buy this phone again and would highly recommend this product!,Postif
"I can get reception where my wife's iPhones can't. For the price, this is the best smart phone I have ever had. I have had iPhone and Samsung before this and I'm sticking with this brand. Battery lasts longer too.",Postif
"This is a fantastic phone! Compared to ANY phone in this price range, it is the best! Not sure I'm a ""power user"" but I use a lot of graphics and drawing apps, as well as a highly-customized launcher and keypad. As reasonably priced as this phone is, $250+ is still a big purchase for me. And this is one that I am very happy to have made!

Haven't experienced a ""con"" yet. And the Oreo update rolled out last week!",Postif
"Transitioned to this from a galaxy s6. This is an amazing budget phone, you can't beat it at the price. Much better than the honor 7x as you get an extra gig of ram and twice the storage. Great battery life, beatiful screen

My only complaints:
Screen scratches easily. I've constantly used tempered glass screen protectors to help stop that.
Still no Oreo update in May of 2018.. but it is supposed to be here anytime.
App crashed are random.. far in between, but random and unexpected.

Got an additional one for my wife and talking my grandmother into transitioning from her galaxy s5 to this too.",Postif
"Excellent phone...I have on At&t and works great ...Yes I have 4G LTE ..The speed is better than any phone out there..Looks really nice..you get so much its worth it... First you get 64 GB alone then 4 gig of Ram.. also it updated to Android Oreo....listen plain and simple want a phone with all stuff you need get this phone

Note : no NFC ..but I don't use google pay..and the battery is not removable...but for me who cares the price is right.

For $229 ..You Can't complain.",Postif
"I use my phone primarily to listen to music, videos, podcasts, and audio books, both with and without headphones or bluetooth. My old LG G4 for $250 has a great speaker and this phone was no where close to the same speaker quality. The speaker on this phone is quiet, shrill, and very poor quality even when using the headphone jack. I returned it.",Negatif
"Odd thing I noticed after using this phone for a few days: I'm left handed, therefore I hold the phone with my left hand and support it with my right thumb.
Unfortunately the speaker is exactly in the spot where my thumb goes on the bottom. I keep turning up the volume, wondering why the sound is so low. Then I move my thumb and it's loud.

No other issues I can think of yet after using it for less than a week. Will update later if anything comes up.",Postif
"I've only been using this phone for a week, but the first impression couldn't be better. Fast, reliable and, even though I'm not a photographer, I think that pictures are more than decent. Screen is big and bright, nice resolution. Totally worth it considering the price point.",Postif
"Like it so far. A bit slower on some games than iPhone 8, some weird patterning issues in background stuff, can't change notification volumes without changing ringtone volumes.
Nice weight, nice size.
Color palette is a rude awakening after Basic Amoled Galaxy for the past 5 years. Hurts my eyes a bit even with eye safe setting and twilight. No auto-stabilizing on video and photo. This is a biggie if you like to take photos. Still a good camera, though, even if low-light (as many people have said) is not good. Battery? Better by far for certain games than a similarly aged iPHone 8. Lighter than iphone 8 even with the Spigen case on. REALLY light with the provided Huawei case on. Overall, a good deal on a great phone. No real complaints.",Postif
"After a month I'm very happy with the Mate SE, much more so than the Honor 6X (which I returned). Bright screen, always super fast, uses the 4G LTE bands that AT&T operates on in my area, really good call quality, more than ample storage, decent-or-better camera, and the EMUI is more customizable than the Honor 6X's version. The fingerprint sensor is a welcome time saver.

The phone has only two mild downsides for me: 1. The media speaker placement and volume aren't great, but they aren't horrible either, and I don't need booming speakers from a phone. 2. The notification LED didn't work until I downloaded, installed and configured the Light Flow app. Now the LED works. It's small and dim compared to what I was used to, but it's visible enough.

The Mate SE ships with a case but I opted to buy a tougher one, the Spigen. https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Huawei-Resilient-Absorption/dp/B076V3D2F5/ref=sr_1_2?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1529708632&sr=1-2&keywords=huawei+mate+se+spigen Glad I did. Dropping phones had been rare for me, but I managed to drop this one twice in only a month, and with no ill effects on it. Would the standard case have protected it? I'll never know and I don't care. I trust the case I bought.",Postif
"This Mate SE is my second Huawei and has a few shortcomings. It will not access a 5G wireless router whereas my 5 yr old Mate 2 would do so. The battery life is shorter than my Mate 2, but not a real problem.
Having said that, in other ways, the Mate SE is superior. The display is clearer; the colors more vivid, the camera superior, the bluetooth is far better, the overall speed of all the functions is pretty amazing
Setup was extremely easy, and all of my settings, contacts, apps, etc, imported via Google with just one touch. I don't swallow the spying nonsense and barely gave the spiel a thought. I would recommend this phone with the caveat about the 5G and battery life.",Postif
"I placed the order for a new Huawei Mate SE phone Sunday and got it 2 days later as anyone would expect via Amazon Prime. I have been waiting for my holiday gift since the order was completed at Amazon. This is my second Huawei phone. So, my expectation is very high. I have had my Huawei Mate 8 for almost 3 years with great experience: great battery life, much better camera than other big name's, running smoothly, and no damages after dropping many times etc. I still use it with little issues. So, I decided to get a Huawei phone again for next 3 years or longer hopefully. This time, I like to get a smaller screen size, specifically a little less wide than Mate 8's. After finishing my order at Amazon, I can't wait for receiving the new phone - Huawei Mate SE. Wow, it is an amazing phone after playing it a little bit. The size is just a great fit with my hands. Installing a few popular Apps runs very smooth. There are a lot of popular Apps pre-loaded on the Mate SE. I will explore more features on this Huawei Mate SE...",Postif
"This phone is fantastic and screaming value.
The form factor is great (thin and tall with small bezel and soft angles), the screen and camera are really good, and the (active) dual SIM card feature a godsend for foreign travelers like me. it feels like a much more premium phone. Too early to say how durable battery will be, but so far so good easily a (light) day use and more. Couldn't be happier.",Postif
"Awesome value, buy this phone. Only things missing, NFC, temperature and some other none important feature. Check the Hauwei web site to find other unmentioned features the phone does have. Daylight pictures are outstanding, night time pictures could be better. If picture taking is your main concern buy a camera, the pictures this phone takes are good enough for most. Buy the phone and enjoy all that it can do including Android 8.0 which will update when you start the phone.",Postif
"This is an awesome phone considering the price point. I already own a blu vivo 8 and this is a much better phone in terms of performance. The mate SE runs very smooth with little to no lag. The phone just performs like a flagship phone. i really don't care that it doesn't have usb type c because all my previous phones were micro usb. except the Blu pure xr which i owned briefly. The only issue i have with the phone is the display which comes out of the box looking a little bit too warm. Luckily , this can be adjusted in the display setting menu. The colors on the display are a little bit muted and i would have loved it if it was more saturated , which would have let the colors pop out more. I wish they would have put a color saturation slider in the settings menu, honestly i don't know why phone makers don't have this option by default (The closest i have seen to it is video enhance on the note 8). This phone seems to have the same color issue with the Pixel XL 2, although google fixed that with an update. I hope Huawei will also update the color saturation and make it more vivid. This is still a fantastic phone, which i have no regrets buying. I have no problem recommending this phone.
Update: I recently noticed that the brightness of the screen would automatically dim when I open apps even though I have got auto brightness set to off. Huawei needs to look into this issue.",Postif
"Bought this phone as a backup for my Huawei Honor 8. Good phone, but not as good as my original Honor 8, so I gave it to my daughter. She loves it!
Also recommended it to a couple friends to replace their old Samsung's & the like their Mate SE's too!
Overall great product at a great price!",Postif
"Very fast. I have a galaxy s7 and it is a pretty good phone, but mate se is faster. For a budget phone it is very good. The camera is not as good as s7, but it costs much less. In bright situation the photos are good, but in low light situation the image quality goes down. The finger print on this phone is VERY fast! just a touch and it is unlocked. The position is very good, it lets you to drop down the notification bar which is good for a person with small hand.

Overall, good phone at a very good price.",Postif
"This is my 2nd Huawei phone. The first one I bought during a trip to Asia unfortunately was not compatible with the US networks. This one completely works! I've got LTE through TMobile. Happy with the 64gb memory and battery life. Rear camera isn't bad, simulates the blurring or bokeh effect of the iPhone by having dual rear cameras. Fingerprint reader works faster than that of my wife's iPhone. For all the hardware available: 64gb memory (expandable with micro SD) octacore processor, HD+ screen, 3340 mAmp battery, its really worth the price.",Postif
"I've only had this phone two weeks now. I honestly love it. Looks great, is small and comfortable, and is fast, to boot! I'm very pleased. I was skeptical because I can't even pronounce the brand name, nor have I heard of it before. However, it's been treating me well and has exceeded my expectations. The camera is pretty decent, as well (something I was concerned about). Definitely a better quality phone than the price leads you to believe. If you're on the fence, I suggest you take the plunge.",Postif
"I have had the phone for a couple months now. I am coming from an HTC Desire 510 with 8 gigs of storage.. 8 gigs! So anything would have been an upgrade. One problem I had initially with the Mate SE was that I couldn't receive mms messages (group, Pic, sound texts, etc.) I figured out I had to reset some apn settings I found on cricket's website. Some negatives: the sound quality isn't the best, but it's as if I have gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore. The phone has also spontaneously restarted itself a few times, but it's not been a big deal. It feels like good sturdy hardware but it is very smooth and slippery. I'm happy using the clear tpu case it came with. The camera is fine for my standards. I like the 64 gigs of storage and 4 gigs of memory. It's pretty zippy. I LOVE the fingerprint scanner on the back and the ability to pull down notifications with it. The scanner is fast and accurate. I like the display. I'm using a nova launcher and it all functions great. Very happy for the price I paid.",Postif
"After using iphone since its introduction, never thought would like any other phone. After getting tired of low quality voice reception and battery and cost of new iphone, settled for Huawei unlocked phone after lots of hesitation. Surprisingly, this turned out to be great pick and happy with the purchase. I like my phone to have good quality phone voice quality and reception, good emailing and good pictures. This phone does not disappoint. Expensive phones finally have a competition.",Postif
"For $229. What a nice phone, does everything as advertised without a glitch and at very fast speeds. Enjoy it way more than the iPhone 5c it replaced, really like the drag accross the screen to type feature, and great to increase your memory with a SD card. Most normal people will not be disappointed with this purchase unless if you need the option of sending videos via SMS, which it doesn't offer. Thanks Amazon",Postif
"I like the most is very quick to transfer my old phone into my new phone without calling tracfone company just answer all the question in the phone,the camera really good,and the battery last longer until i get home from work,,maps is good .Its look very nice ,thin and brand new you can compare of ipone quality.I recommend this product if you want to save money no monthly bills just load one time in a yr and watch before expiration you can load more mins,its depends also how you use it.whats inside the box,adptor charger, pin and basic bookletguide ,i didnt read all yet whats inside if they have warranty,Only 1slot drawer for nano sims card and sdcard small size.I love my phone",Postif
This phone lived up to all my expectations and more. I was on the fence with this phone and the Moto g6..but the specs for the mate was much better not to mention the dual SIM cards. If you're looking for a great non-flaghip phone with flagship specs this is the phone for you. Oh and it works flawlessly with MetroPCS/TMobile.,Postif
"I have been using this phone for a few weeks now. This may not be a ""flagship"" phone, but it sure feels and runs like one. If price and quality are important, then this is definitely the phone for you. I use my phone for everything, browsing the web, Netflix, YouTube, Amazon. It's also my only phone, no landline. I've owned several Galaxy series phones, the old lady used them, I wouldn't trade two of her s7's for one mate se. This doesn't have some of the most up to date features, but I haven't found that it takes away from the experience. This not only feels like a quality phone, it operates like one.",Postif
"I recently retired. I was issued an iPhone 6 plus at work. I decided that I did not want an IOS device and decided to shop Android devices.
This phone is a great balance of features vs. price I've had for 1 week.

The good:
Good battery life
Great screen
Very responsive
Easy to use
Pretty good camera
Super fast fingerprint reader
Very reliable so far.

The bad:
Shaky video
Low light photos a little grainy
Hard to pronounce phone name Huawei (wowway) :-)",Postif
"OMG I love this phone! It has all the power I need to do any task I need it to do. And there is no bloatware on it like other proprietary phones. Just android plain and simple. The camera is awesome. Front AND back. Seriously, why pay 500 or a thousand bucks when you can pay 200 and get nearly the same quality? I'm completely happy with my purchase. iPhone who?",Postif
I give Two stars because. Incoming calls are not answered by me. The phone does it automatically. I don't know someone called unless I hear them saying hello. I need a replacement,Negatif
"This is a good phone if you want most of the features and performance of a high end phone but don't want to spend $1,000. It's decently powerful, it works perfectly for Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, web browsing, and a few simple games I tried. The sound and camera aren't as great as some of the flagship phones, but they are decent. The battery is pretty big so it should last all day for casual use, if you aren't running 50 things with the brightness cranked. It also comes with a free clear case which is nice, most companies don't do that. So it's great for casual users unless you really want to spend 4-5x as much for a flagship phone.",Postif
"Only one day in and I am blown away. I had a surprise last week when my Samsung S8 screen stopped working all of a sudden (no drop, nothing). Took it for a screen replacement which was going to cost $229 plus tax. Got a phone call from the tech saying the motherboard was shot. Awesome.

Anyway. After a bunch of research I decided to pull the trigger on this budget phone. I liked the aluminum back and the specs seemed good enough. So happy!!

The UI is better than Samsung's for sure. Photos not quite as good. Speed seems the same in apps. Fingerprint on this is far superior to the S8 (better placement and faster).

I'm really impressed. And heck. If something happens to it I am only out $229. Win win. By this phone.",Postif
"I love this phone. Works very well. Great features. Looks and acts much more high end than it's price would indicate. I bought the gold one, and it looks very classy. I am totally satisfied with my purchase, and the price point was low enough that I will not mind replacing in a few years if needed, unlike with an $800 phone. Glad I took the chance on a brand I was unfamiliar with. Also, Huawei support was great the one time I needed to call them with a question.",Postif
"Lightning fast, fingerprint scanner is virtually instantaneous, bright HD display, great build quality, clean design, size is just right, and photos are nice and clear. My only real issue with it is that the speaker is very ""tinny"" and lacks bass. The volume can get very loud though thankfully and there is a headphone jack at least. It's an incredible phone for the price and despite the speaker, it's the best smart phone I've had to date (LG V3, LG V20, and ZTE Axon 7).",Postif
"Love it!
What a phone. Works absolutely great out of the box.
I'm on T-mobile and if you select automatic mobile network it will work on 4G LTE with no issue whatsoever.
Comes with Android 7, but you can upgrade to 8 rigth away like I did and you're set.
Alluminium body, great back camera, decent front camera, amazing storage of 64gb and 4 gb ram.
Screen is top-notch and battery lasts for at least one day of power usage, two days if you use it lightly.
I'm impressed.
Huawei is the new way to go.",Postif
"Switching over from years of LG. My V10 went through batteries like it's no one's business, as did my other LGs. This phone isnt perfect still learning it. The battery life of the huawi is great, never have to take my charger with me last all day and if not using regains some of it's charge. The OS is 8 too that takes time to get used to, what's nice about that is the self cleaning cashe. Doesn't seem to get above 600mb. The LGs had no problem getting over 2gb.",Postif
"I wanted a phone that had a great camera. Check! And great battery life. Check! The camera is the best phone camera I have ever had. In low light, bright light, whatever... It takes fabulous pics. The battery lasts 2 days with pretty heavy usuage! The speaker is very loud too. And it's fast responsive. So many pluses and honestly not any minues I can think of. Buy it! You will not regret it, I promise! XO",Postif
"I was looking for an upgrade and this phone is awesome! It is fast enough to tackle apps I throw at it and there is no lag with the EMUI interface. You have to be nuts to buy an expensive phone on a contract when this is available, unlocked, at a great price.",Postif
"when my LG G3 started to fry my battery i new it was time for a new cell phone, but i didnt want to spend $600 plus on a phone.
i did some research and found the Huawei mate SE, this phone has really impressed me and im very happy with it, i have been using it non stop and the battery life is incredible it can go three days on one charge using facebook,instagram,messenger and others without using battery saver mode
i have not not had any problems and im very happy with it",Postif
"I love this phone I only wish it was slightly wider and a full 6 inches instead of 5.93 other than that I really have no complaints. In fact, if at all possible, this is the only brand of phone that I will ever buy again. It has all of the bells and whistles of any of the higher priced phones (Samsung/apple in particular) and even better customization. Just the fact that you can have 64gb of internal memory for only 250.00...what is not to love.",Postif
"The phone has everything I need from a smartphone at a great price.
My only gripe is the speaker isn't great, but it works well enough, and for movies and music I just use headphones and thankfully there is a headphone jack for my daily driver headphones. Also USB-C would have been nice, but it's whatever.

Overall this phone is snappy, responsive, has a great finger print scanner and has suited all my needs so far.
Definitely recommend, especially at this price!",Postif
"All I can say is wow. I really thought I'd be disappointed, but I was not. This phone is a great phone. It's fast and clear and I can hear. I haven't ever used it up to my ear to talk because I'm a headset person, but it works great with Bluetooth. I'm not sure that anyone should ever purchase a phone through their carrier when you can get a super high quality phone for a 1/2 of the price of a phone with similar specs through the carrier.",Postif
Love this phone got the grey version and people won't stop telling me it looks and feels like an iPhone then I tell em what it is and it's much cheaper and they are shocked. Zero complaints so far super fast boots up with ease. Camera is good but with water shots it struggles a bit but nothing too bad. Can insert dual Sims but I have a 128 gig micro SD card in mine. It comes with emui 5.0 but there is an update to 9 right out of the box. Some people complain about the lack of a USb type c really I could care less it comes with microUSb. Bottom line is you can't beat this phone for the price,Postif
I bought this for my wife and so far her and I love them. Best phone for price that I could find.The phone looks and feels like it costs $500-$800. Not as fast as the flagship phones but I can wait 1 second for screen to load instead of .5 seconds. Buy it you wont be disappointed.,Postif
Love this phone. Works and feels as a high end phone. And I got such peace knowing I am not making payments for 2 years in a iPhone. Why waste your hard earned money. Some of my iPhones won't even update anymore. Great purchase .,Postif
This is a really really good phone when you factor in the price point this phone is an amazing phone in my opinion is the best phone on the market well yes it might lack some of the high-end features of the iPhone x like facial recognition I gladly give that up for the $800 price time difference I cannot recommend this phone enough the screen has been Fantastic Four picture quality no scratches processor speeds fantastic hard drive space fantastic I've had this phone for over 2 months and I have had zero issues with it.,Postif
"I havent had any issues with the phone except the gps. I dont know if its not compatible with google maps or vice versa but it's so incredibly glitchy... It freezes, doesn't always orient to my location, and just sucks.

Pros:
- The camera is incredible!! Everyone always wants to use my phone for pictures.
- battery life lasts long time when in battery saver mode
- phone calls are fine",Postif
"Getting this phone setup and using it was non-eventful. It is fast and screen has bright image. Very easy to transfer my information from old phone using AT&T Mobile Transfer app. If this phone continues to work this well for a couple of years it will be the best I've owned. My original plan was to get the Samsung Galaxy S8 (old phone S5) but given price I gave the Huawei Mate SE a try. So far, I think it's great.",Postif
Fast shipping and packaged well! We love this phone! Bought it a few months ago and have had not one issue! Its been dropped and no scratches or breaks! Wasnt sure about ordering this brand and honestly have not one regret! Has a lot of space and ways to add so much more space. Also super easy to keep the storage cleaned out and battery last a long time! One of the best purchases we have made so far online!,Postif
"This is a great phone! I know there has been some negative press about Huawei and even warnings. Not sure what all of that is about, but I have zero negative things to say about the phone. It is running Oreo and is fast, snappy! Picture quality is great. Video is great. I am really picky about phones and this one ticks all boxes! I use straight talk and added a 64gb card to it. If you are looking for a budget phone, not sure you can find a better one!",Postif
"I bought this for my partner whose LG Stylo 3 was all smashed up. My partner loves this phone and so do I. We activated on Metro PCS which is basically T-Mobile. The phone has great specs, never lags, the camera is good with a lot of features I wish my Pixel XL has. I would rather have this phone that my Pixel XL. I'm really happy with this phone and it's performance. Huawei makes fantastic phones.",Postif
"I would give this 5 stars but GPS is horrible. I have used programs to help but to no avail. I use my phone for tracking my business miles thru MileIQ and the phone just will not reliably track my driving miles with the GPS. Otherwise, its a great phone with awesome features for a basic user. I do not game and do not listen to music on my phone. But otherwise, a great little phone for the price. Gave up my Iphone for this and was not disappointed in the basics...only the one gripe about the GPS.",Postif
"Huawei continues to deliver high features at a fraction of Samsung or Apple. I needed another phone as my honor 5x was over 3 years old. I was still impressed with what my old handset could provide but outdated Android Software.

Which networks; Apparently no one can read the Amazon Description GSM: In Mu'rica T-Mobile or AT&T. I use Straight Talk AT&T no issues

Pros:
Metal Silver Case; looks sharp and included a outer protective sleave to protect the finish.
Finger Print recognizer is faster than my Honor 5X
Camera what an improvement. I'm taking less fuzzy pictures
Uploaded Huawei Themes; now it emulates icons similar to Samsung or Apple. Cool feature and free
Screen is beautiful and battery has lasted about as long as my old honor 5X throughout the day.

Struggles:
I had to reinstall the GMAIL app. Got hung up trying to sign in to multiple accounts.
Bluetooth seems to struggle on initial setup with headphones. Still pairing with vehicles will update.
No USB C. Slow charge like my older 5X

Overall I am impressed. I purchase my phones outright because I do not finance a phone for two years. Seriously, is that Phone X worth $999 that is made next door to the Huawei Chinese Factory for a quarter of the price?

Update:
Included Android 8.0 Oreo updated on the the west coast the best coast 11 May 2018 on a budget phone.",Postif
"Nice phone at any price and a super phone for $250.00. Once I found the transfer apps I got almost everything swapped over from my aging Samsung Galaxy. 64BG is lots nicer than having only 16GB memory, nice photos, pretty screen. The only problem so far is they won't ""pair"" with my hearing aids. I switched from AT&T to Consumer Cellular, happy there too.",Postif
"This phone was a huge surprise. Even the camera, that I thought wouldn't deliver, was very good enough to take good pictures. I, always thought, there is no excuse to buy a $800-$1000 phone in our time when you can get a decent phone for 1/4 of that price. What I didn't like is the EMUI (won't bother you) and also the unlocking of the device (you have to go through the swiping up). Overall, a great phone from people who know how to make a cheap phone for the working class.",Postif
"I absolutely love this phone! Seriously.

My three most recent androids were Blu phones prior to this (all 3 failed after about a year and crashed a lot of the time and didn't consistently send texts) and was considering an Apple iPhone.

This phone completely exceeded my expectations. It is absolutely the best of any android phone I've ever used!

Fast, no crashes and good quality feel to it.",Postif
Overall solid performer. Was nice to get an upgrade of the honor 7x in sense of ram and memory. Nice having cases out lwary for it although I would like to see a full body case for the with a attached screen protector. I would say it is safe to assume it will receive 8.0 Oreo like the 7x is supposed to. It is worth the value of what u get,Postif
"Pros:
great screen
fingerprint sensor
great value
Powerful and with good storage

Cons:
Speaker quality is ok, but my moto g4 had a better sound
Not a stock Android rom, the interface is somewhat improved over the default android but it takes a day or two getting used to it.

Verdict:
I like this phone very much and recommend it.",Postif
Very nice very cheap (priced) why would you pay more. I purchased this for my wife but had an upgraded galaxy for myself I bought a while ago. Wish I had found this phone 6 months ago. I spent $400 for an Edge 7. I could have bought this for $250. I can see why some stores don't want to push this. Their lines would run dry with people purchasing the Huawei Mate SE. Too funny,Postif
"I LOVE this phone! Very nice in appearance. Got a refurb, but very gently used- looks and feels new. Some of the ""minor"" things that can irritate you with a phone are all taken care of...very pleased. Great system. My first Huawei, will definitely buy again from this company.",Postif
"5 months later and this phone is the best phone I have ever owned, works like the day I bought it. For 230$ the phone feels like a luxery phone with it's metal body and doesn't feel lightweight like most cheap phones to. I never thought I would move away from Samsung, but Huawei blows Apple and Samsung out of the park. I also bought my fiance one for her birthday :)",Postif
"This phone has about everything I need. I'm not buying into all the Huawei spying crap that's going on so I'm very happy. The only thing I miss is gorilla glass, but for the price, it's understandable you can't have everything. I don't care it doesn't have NFC because it's a feature I don't use anyways. Charging is not the fastest either but it easily lasts a full day so night time charging solves that issue.
The phone makes pretty good quality pictures, not the best but more than acceptable. For great pictures, I still have my Nikon camera. Lots of storage (more than I need), enough RAM, fast enough CPU, bright screen... I'm a happy camper who's done with expensive Samsungs now.",Postif
"Upgrade from a Honor 6X after dropping that phone and smashing the screen. I loved my old phone and this one is even better. Very snappy, wonderful build quality. Huawei makes the best phones for the money in my opinion.",Postif
"This phone in incredible. I have had it for about five months now, and it still works as well as it did when I first bought it.
Pros: Dual rear cameras, great picture quality, fast finger print response, navigates quickly through apps, large high quality screen, loads of storage
Cons: While the portrait mode is awesome 95% of the time, sometimes it gets wonky and focuses on random things in the background as well as the subject. This is literally the only con I can think of.

For the price point, this is probably the best phone on the market right now. I love it.",Postif
I only recently converted from a Nokia Windows phone to Android since I was tired of nothing being compatible. Tried a low-end Samsung first and was really disappointed--good screen definition but it was slow and I disliked the home button. I then decided to upgrade to the Huawei Mate SE instead and have been totally impressed. It's responsive for my needs. I enjoy the simplicity of the fingerprint button to unlock the phone. I'm not the most sophisticated smart phone user but I can confidently recommend this phone.,Postif
"This is a great phone, the specs of this phone are great, for the money you are paying. I highly recommend this phone, what more could you want for less than 300 dollars great camera, great quality and great battery. Perfect for anyone looking for a great phone with out wasting 500 dollars. Also it has a 1 year warranty which is great!",Postif
"I had some trouble transferring data from my old phone to this new one. Most were unable to be transferred  yes this is partially my fault for not keeping my backup current, but the fact that NO transfer programs were able to work with this phone was concerning. Otherwise, it is working fine and is a very nice midrange phone.",Postif
Had it for a day and so far I'm blown away! I have been buying Huawei phones for a long time and they never disappoint. For the price it's a no brainer. I will update,Postif
"I have purchased many many unlocked phones, but this one is by far the best. The phone is fast, copies the good parts about iPhones, provides plenty of customization, and is speedy with very few hiccups.
For $250 , this phone is a steal.",Postif
"I love this phone it is worth way more. It's a great buy and so much to the phone. Easy to use, a lot of memory, takes great pictures, has great sound, everything on it is perfect. I will say though I wasn't happy that it didn't come with a lot of stuff to protect the phone in the big box it was shipped in and also I had a deep scratch on the bottom of my screen that even when I put the screen protector on you can still see some of it.",Postif
"Is Huawei using this device to spy on me? Possibly.

Is Huawei using this device to give me accurate turn-by-turn directions? Nope.",Postif
"Loving it so far. Has a great feel from aluminum construction, tons of ram and storage and the battery is phenomenal. Can't recommend enough for a sub $300 phone. For context, I'm coming from a galaxy s5",Postif
Nsa already gather data. Facebook sells our data to companies that don't necessarily have to American based. If your worried don't buy. But let me tell you this is one of the most well crafted fast sleek and optimized machines for modern day smart phones. Best believe I'm on a prepaid plan with one of the strongest quickest phones on the market.,Postif
"I've had the phone for a few hours, so far so good. I transferred my number from my old straight talk phone. Sadly is only supports GSM (I knew beforehand). I had to choose between using AT&T and t mobile chip that straight talk offers.",Postif
"I upgraded to this phone from a Moto G5+. The battery life is REALLY nice, the screen is clear and beautiful, it has plenty of performance. The only negatives I have is that it doesn't do 5Ghz wifi, and it uses a micro-usb instead of type-c. Both are minor points that I can happily live with.

There is no better phone in this price range.",Postif
"only 3 cons #1 not enough customization with emui user interface. downloaded nova launcher
#2 no usb c #3 branding on the front. none of which takes a full star away. maybe half a star. everything else is a pro, phone is fast,great screen, metal back and came with a tpu clear case",Postif
"Amazing. Honestly I love this phone. Bought it to use it as a replacement for my Xperia XZ, for a budget device it has everything you'll need and more. Love the hardware, love the screen, love the battery, that camera it's just ok, it has micro usb not USB type C (me), downfiring speakers (bummer) but besides those things I can't complain.",Postif
"great phone for the price. way faster than my old honor 6x. This Mate Se has extra 1gb ram and 64gb storage. Definitely well worth the extra few bucks over the honor 7x. The old 6x was laggy and freezes. So far no problems with this mate yet. the only complain i have is the video. Pictures are nice, but video not as sharp as my old iphone 6.",Postif
Ok phone has issues and bugs,Negatif
"An awesome cell phone!!!. I'm thinking that Apple & Samsung & LG are terrified of the Huawei company....and especially Apple.
Doing everything they can to keep Huawei OUT of the mainstream USA marketplace. Millions of Chinese citizens are 'rockin out' w/ their Huawei phones and loving it!! This is the BEST cell phn I've ever owned. @ $250.....??? Are you kidding?? You will not regret buying this phone.",Postif
"WOW This is an excellent phone with great functionality beautiful screen and easy to maneuver, no bloatware - unlocked.
I refuse to buy an iphone and I am totally pleased with this phone , very fast processor smooth performance and nice battery life for all day events.",Postif
"I've had this phone for about six months and I use it heavily every day for work and play... Is been Absolutely flawless!!

The touch screen had EXCELLENT responsive, the screen is large and very clear, the phone is Fast with a 2.36G octa core CPU, 4 gigs of RAM and 64G of storage.
Apps open usually in a second or less, web surfing also loads pages in less than a second most of the time. Phone switches beautifully between WiFi and cellular data, the camera takes excellent pictures with it's dual rear cameras and even the front facing selfie cam with basic built in beautify options work well.

The screen has an excellent built in coating that makes your finger slide over the glass very easy and it almost never builds up fingerprints, but when it does, just wiping it on my shirt cleans them off almost completely.

I have scores of apps on the phone and there are no conflicts with any of them, even lesser known apps work great as well as the bigger ones like Twitter, Skype, Facebook etc.

The battery life is very, very good as I rarely have to charge it more than once a day even using it for 7-10 hours a day with videos, movies, being on the phone for sometimes a couple of hours a day for work etc. It's 3385MAH battery works excellent.

The fingerprint scanner is BETTER than on my Samsung Galaxy, BLU and LG phone to, though the LG is second best. Just touching even a part of my finger to the sensor opens up the apps or unlocks the phone.

While the phone does NOT have an encrypted file system, which I really wish it did, it does come with a built in encrypted file safe for photos, documents, music or anything else you want to put in it.

It also has a built in app protector so that no app can be accessed without either the password or your fingerprint which again works within a third of a second every time. I like this as I'm very big on security.

So far I've gotten numerous updates from Blu including updating to Android 8.0 and many security updates.

I had an issue with certain apps and I contacted their online customer service via the chat feature. I got someone within 30 seconds and unlike most customer service who give you basic bs answers or stock answers, they understood the problem right away, which was not related to an issue with the phone but was a problem with the latest version of Google play store. Once they told me to remove it and download it again, the problem disappeared right away never to return.

Even though I have a good case in the phone, I've dropped the phone about 7 or 8 times and the phone still works great with no scratches on the screen at all.

I also like that the phone requires you to enter the password every three regardless for security reasons.

The phone call quality is absolutely beautiful and clear as it uses 4G for HD quality sound as good as my brothers $900 Galaxy 8. I've also NEVER had a dropped call even when being on conference calls of an hour or more and everyone sounds like they're right in the room with me. I also like that the phone has a built in Black list option to stop annoying spam calls which seems to be getting worse lately.

This is just an absolutely fantastic phone and several of my co workers have bought them after seeing my phone and hearing my praise of it. It's no wonder that Huawei sales have no SURPASSED APPLE to become the number twi phone seller in the world.",Postif
"I was limping along with my Nexus 6P and it finally decided enough was enough. I wanted an interim phone to get me through to the next Pixel release and decided on this since my Huawei 6P lasted me 2.5 years which is a lot for an android device. I am very impressed with this phone. For the price it is quite feature rich. The system is crazy smooth. The storage is 64GB which is twice that of my 6P. Memory stands strong at 4GB. This is great as long as management of it stays on point. The camera is good. Not great but it is quite usable for a device at this price point.

Pros:
- 64GB storage
- 4GB Ram
- 6"" screen
- Works on Tmobile and AT&T LTE bands (no verizon or sprint)
- Crazy fast fingerprint reader in the CORRECT SPOT
- FM Radio and a headphone jack (common in Chinese phones)
- Good camera, but won't blow anyone away
- Dual SIM with great management tools
- Actual good battery life will get you through the day easy
- Slick all metal design, this is nice but also slippery. Luckily the phone comes with a free clear case. I bought the Spigen Honor 7X case though.
- $230???

Cons:
- Micro USB connection, better dig up your old cables
- No NFC, I use contactless payment a lot and this hurts
- No wireless charging, but this is a metal phone so eh
- EMUI skin is quite intrusive, I recommend Nova or Google Launcher on top, much better this way
- Only running Android 7.0, hopefully the Honor 7X beta program means Oreo will be coming to this device eventually, don't hold your breath though.
- This is a Chinese phone and these companies sometimes have questionable practices when using your personal data. Keep this in mind when buying lower end devices such as this. Probably doesn't matter though since your data is being harvested and sold by all phone manufacturers most likely. Might as well save a buck.

Overall I am very happy and impressed with this phone. Budget phones have come so far from the last time I had a lower end phone that I honestly did not expect this device to perform the way it is. This phone is easily worth the price. Micro USB being the biggest downfall of this device is understandable at this price point. This phone may get me to skip the new Pixel altogether! Buy this if you need something to hold you off until the next big thing OR if you are budget minded but still looking for a feature rich device.

**1 MONTH UPDATE**

This phone is still a great deal and I figured I would put a few more thoughts in this review since I have been using it for about a month. First the reason I am dropping this device to only 4 stars, battery management. This battery management is probably the opposite of what you think, it is TOO AGGRESSIVE. This phone has settings to kill what it considers ""power intensive apps"" when the device is locked and the screen is off. This option can be turned off which I have done, but it does not appear to be listening to me. The result of this is that I do not receive notifications for messages, smart things events, and many other things that I want to know as soon as they happen. Therefore I end up getting 3 or 4 notifications when I unlock the device. I have white listed all the apps that I want to continue running but the phone does not care. This is pretty annoying so I may end up rooting the device to remove EMUI.

The second annoyance I have found is that the phone does not allow you to set specific notification sounds per app. You get ONE notification noise for ALL your notifications. That sucks pretty hard. But, per my previous point, the phone doesn't tell you when you have notifications anyway so whatever I suppose.

The other notable point is that this device DID receive an Android Oreo update. This is great and unexpected on a budget device so I am happy to be on this later version of Android. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to save them from dropping a star.

Still a great device! Hopefully I can figure out a workaround for the battery optimization that kills your apps.",Postif
"I did try the finger print ,it,s ok i guess but i did not like it as i have big hands and i did not really like it.so i tryed the password thing and you guess it a pain .over all the phone is easy to hear well talking.easy to hold with a new cover.i bought a black plastic rubber one.i,m sure glad i did not half to work two weeks to pay for my phone .",Postif
"The Product is very vibrant and fast with lots and lots of storage however, the camera just wasn't what I was expecting, its not crisp it overcompensates by over sharpening photos. To put it in perspective the iphone 6 camera is much better.",Postif
"So far love this phone. Fast, smooth and feels great. Glad I got it.",Postif
"Two weeks into using and am in love with how it works, smooth and fast. I forgot to add it was $229.00 when I looked at it, a week later I went to buy it and it was $20.00 more, then a week later it was back down to $229.00, was not happy and called Amazon and they said, more or less, tough luck.",Postif
"So I finally got my phone connected to Metro PCS the reviews are correct, so far the phone works amazingly and it's super fast. I'm taking a trip to California and this phone will be put to the test. Oh and one other positive the reviews say it doesn't have expandable memory but it does.",Postif
"Wow. Cant belive a phone this inexpensive can be this good. Bought it as a travel phone backup, but may switch to Android over this. Keep in mind wont work for Verizon and there is some USA controversy over the manufacture, which seems unwarranted, but the quality of this phone at this price is just incredibly impressive.",Postif
"Absolutely stunning looks and performance for the price! Mine automatically updated to Android 8 and switching on and ported across all my ""Google"" data with no problems. Why pay $000,s when you can get similar performance and specifications for less than $250?",Postif
"There is only one issue that I have with the phone. When I turn on and my screen brightness is set lower than max it starts out bright then immediately adjusts to the lower setting. Everything else is perfect. Beautiful phone, great weight, fast, excellent picture and sound quality. The wife is silently envious",Postif
"Too soon to tell upgraded from Moto 5 or 4 has more features than the Moto had to buy a case because it feels them other than that it seems okay for a cheap phone

Updated...had phone for 2 weeks and the battery wouldn't take a charge.",Negatif
"Don't spend more than you have to.
This will do everything you need at a fraction of the price.
I just love this phone & Incredible overall value!
Just don't expect an Iphone Camera at this price range.
Camera is Okayish... otherwise perfect",Postif
Nice phone for the bucks with vibrant specs and nice feel. There is one problem that I have with it that I had with my Huawei Honor 6 and that is dropping calls that go directly to voicemail. I don't know if that's a problem with the carrier or Huawei phones.,Postif
"I purchase this phone . Because this phone is beyond any expectations I had for a smartphone and available for an incredible price .This phone has everything I needed .Dual sim card or micro sd card allows two phone number or unlimited storage , massive screen larger than 1080 HD ,decent camera good loud speaker fast fingerprint ID.One thing is this phone only support 2.4 GHZ wifi not 5 GHZ wifi . but overall this phone is good.",Postif
"It is just ok. Looks great. Fingerprint reader is lightning fast (much, much faster than Moto G4 Plus) - didn't realize my G4 was slow until trying this. Unfortunately fingerprint reader is on the back (I know this is the trend, but don't like hunting for something I can't see. Bothered me more than I thought it would)

However, response time for starting and switching apps is no faster than my Moto G4 Plus (about the same) and the wifi speed is significantly slower (about 20%) than my Moto G4 Plus (side to side comparision with speedtest). Touch sensitivity is also worse - typing always results in missing characters. The worst thing about this phone is the sound quality. It is absolutely terrible from the internal speaker and also over headsets. I would guess maybe the internal speaker's poor quality is the price for the slim design. Was also inconsistent on Android Auto - sound quality was really, really bad on Android Auto until I found a tip online that said to turn off the 'special effects' from the sound settings (this fixed the problem). Also, not a big fan of EMUI (the customized version of Android), prefer the closer to stock Android experience of the Moto phones.

I returned it. Will wait for Moto G6.",Postif
"So far so good with this budget smartphone. A lot of people call this the King of the Budget Smartphones...I must agree.

I'm nitpicking, but here are a few suggestions that would make this phone perfect and probably $50-$75 more expensive, but I would still buy it.
1. Type C USB for charging
2. Dual Band Wifi (AC). Lacking this is a real bummer when a $40 Moto e4 at Walmart at least has dual band wifi
3. This phone only has LTE and would be better with LTE-A
4. fast/turbo charging
5. any type of water resistant rating
6. Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) But Google Photos (the android app version) does a pretty good job of fixing the shaky videos (after you shoot your shaky video)

Overall the phone is Really good and very well priced. And the battery lasts a Long Time! I am coming from a Moto X Pure (2015) edition and the Mate SE battery is 1000x better than my older Moto.

I also purchased the Honor View 10 to compare to the Huawei Mate SE. I know the View 10 has a better processor, more gigs of RAM (6 compared to 4) and double the internal storage, plus other features too...but when comparing them side to side, I don't notice a difference (i.e. speed or lagging) when using daily apps. When I use the Mate SE as a hotspot for my laptop, it is usually as fast as the View 10. I actually now prefer the fingerprint sensor on the back of the Mate SE better than the front of the Honor View 10. Using the sensor on the back seems easier and more comfortable than I ever thought it would.

So I don't think the View 10 is worth 2x the price of the Mate SE.

The Huawei Mate SE is a great budget phone that I am using as my daily phone now. I'm surprised at how much I like it, I did not think that would be the case. And it is not too expensive that I won't be upset replacing it within a year to 18 months with another newer budget phone. It will be interesting to see if Mate SE will still be as fast as it is now in 12 months.",Postif
Bought this phone to give to my wife so she could give her sister her old (but solid) Honor 6x. Where on day to and not much complaint from her except I noticed it got a bit hot the other day. Will update if I notice this to be a patter or something else show undesirable.,Postif
Moved up from Honor 5. Still a decent size if I need to put it in my pocket. Bit more user friendly than the 5- this works well with my Fitbit. Still doesn't do gifs or such but I'll live. Really happy to have storage card like Honor 5 did.,Postif
"I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. Have a great camera, a great processor and plenty of memory. Great quality for the price!",Postif
Has a lot of great features. Super fast. Updated to Oreo as soon as I turned it on. Have not had to reboot it once since I got it. Fingerprint scanner is super quick and reliable. Facial recognition works well too. Battery life is amazing. I can go all day constantly browsing Facebook and whatever and when I get home in the evening it still has 70+% battery life left.,Postif
Really please with the performance of this phone. Nice display with no lag. Battery life is amazing. Better than some of the high priced flag ship phones. I have a Samsung S9+ and this beats it for battery life hands down.,Postif
"Mate SE is an excellent cell phone at a very affordable price. It feels very solid, and look great. The screen has a very good resolution; the battery lasts almost two days with regular use. Then it was updated to Android 8.0. My son loves it.",Postif
All over its a solid phone. I am bit disappointed with the front and back camera quality. They could have increased the cost of phone by another 50 bucks and added a decent camera.,Postif
"This phone was just received and set up. (WE can't get the touch to work, but will continue trying). The phone seems solid and has most of the features that phones costing 2 - 3 times as much offer. Wifey is happy!",Postif
Much better than the $100 Blu phones. Enough memory to get stuff installed and very responsive. A nice phone of you go through many per year like I do and don't want to throw money away.,Postif
Don't hesitate to buy this phone. Unbelievably Great Phone,Postif
"Worked good here in the states, was working good with two different carriers in Panama and then I lost it. At least it wasn't connected to some plan that could be taken advantage of. Will look at buying another one.",Postif
"I will say my daughter has only had the phone for a week but she is very impressed with the speed and camera (what else do teens look for?). I am sure my kid is no different than others who break or lose a phone more often than we like. She was offered an iPhone but declined and preferred an Android. In comparing the phones out there it was a bit difficult to drop $800 or more on a phone which may be lost or broken in a year or two. For the money this phone is hard to beat. 4G of RAM, 64G or internal storage, which can be expanded. Great rear and phone camera, plus a large full HD screen. Sure it is missing Gorilla glass and a few other perks. But I challenge you to find a phone at this price or even close with the features and performance of the Mate SE. Just a helpful hint, when looking for cases you will find more listed for the Honor 7X phone which is identical in size, etc of the Mate SE.",Postif
This is probably the best phone value available. Not sure some people believe price for all the features it has. Up to 3 days on battery life. Have recommend to many friends. Would buy again.,Postif
"So far, the performance of an $800 phone at a fraction of the price! Beautiful display, responsive and fast load times, quality camera. As of day one, I am very happy with my purchase, and am glad I didn't go with an iPhone 8 or S9. So far the only drawback I have found is a lock of accessories, screen protectors, cases, etc. Hopefully that will change in due time.",Postif
"For $225, this thing rocks. Turbo fast. I gave it as a gift to a friend to replace and older iPhone. She loves it.",Postif
"Like this new Android Oreo operating system, lot of new features.",Postif
So far (I've only had it for a few days) this is one of the nicest phones I've had. Works well and takes beautiful pictures. I am using it with a Mint Mobile SIM card and so far I couldn't be happier,Postif
This is a good phone for the price. But has one issue - the navigation keys on the bottom of the screen have response problems. Sometimes I have to press 2-3 time to get a response. I contacted to Amazon about this problem and got a replacement. But the replacement phone has same issue.,Postif
Dont work in United States,Negatif
"This is the best phone I've had in a while. My last device was a Blu which I adored but this one is right up there. Works great, good looking camera as well. Just make sure you case it properly and add a screen protector!",Postif
Only had it for a few weeks but so far I really like it. Works great.,Postif
"I got this phone a couple weeks ago and so far i love it. The Battery is excellent,it will last all day with plenty of charge left. It is very fast,love that 4gb of ram. Picture guality is really good and the sound isn't too bad. I'm coming from a Galaxy S6 phone and i think it is better phone. Very well pleased.",Postif
"Ive had this phone for close to a month now and Im very happy with it. My previous 2 devices were Moto Gs, with the most recent being the G4. The G4 was a great phone that was only hampered by my dumb decision not to get the model with more RAM and Storage. I assumed I would get the G6 when it was released, but the announced specs were disappointing, (this will be the first G6 to not have a 6XX series snapdragon processor), and the price is higher than previous iterations. To be honest, the Moto E5 Plus is more attractive as a true budget phone.
The Huwaei Mate SE had solid reviews and great specs for the price, so I decided to buy it. I also considered waiting for the Nokia 6.1, but again, the specs (3GB RAM and 32GB on base model) dont campare to the Huwaei.
Pros:
Screen - I really like the 18X9 screen. The quality is great, with no color hues.
Fingerprint Scanner - I never understood the big deal about these things, but now I cant imagine living without it. It is lightning fast.
Memory & Storage - I think that anything with less than 4GB of RAM will not last more than a year without starting to significantly lag. With 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage this phone should perform well for a while.
UI - The custom UI is actually pretty decent, and close to stock Android. This was actually the only thing made me consider not purchasing the phone, as Ive enjoyed the stock android on my Motos, and know that the Samsung UI is really annoying. This one is pretty straight forward.
OS - The Android 8.0 update came through today and resolved some issues. The touch sensitivity on the screen was an issue, but seems to be resolved now. Also, I had issues with pairing with my car that are now fixed. Nice!!
Camera - Im not a great judge of picture quality, and Im not going to say that it takes better pictures than my wifes iphone 7. It doesnt. It does, however, take much better photos than my G4 ever did. Thats all I really need. The camera could load faster, but oh well.
Processor - Plenty fast for my needs. In the ballpark of a 6XX series snapdragon, but it does underperform in nearly all benchmark tests. I dont play many games, but I downloaded PubG, just to see how it did, and it played nicely with no lag.
Case - Just want to point out that it comes with a pretty decent clear case. I didnt realize it when I ordered it. Consider that when you purchase the phone.
Cons:
OS - I miss the gesture controls for the camera and flashlight that I had on the Motos.
Network - GSM Only. Not necessarily a negative, but you should be aware of it. I bought a 12 month card for RedPocket and the service is pretty great.
No NFC - Ive never had this, but I imagine its like the FP Scanner. Once you have it, you probably dont want to go without it.
No Type C or turbo charging - For me, this is the only true negative. Fortunately, after nearly a decade of android ownership I have amassed roughly 3 million micro-USB cables, so Im never more than a few feet away from a convenient, albeit slow, charging solution.
Thats all the negatives I can think of right now. All in all, a fantastic phone for $250 (price when I bought it, $229 now). If youre a casual user like myself (no intense games, rarely watch videos), theres no reason to buy anything more expensive than this range of phone.",Postif
I spent days researching for a replacement phone for my dying Note 4. But it needed to be affordable and unlockable. And this phone met all my needs. All I can say is I love it.,Postif
Runs perfectly. The screen is really good and system runs very fast.,Postif
Extremely good deal for what you get. Compared to the competition Huawei can't be beat. The value for your money is amazing. These phones are half the price of a comparable competitors handset.,Postif
"This is like a dream phone as it is fast, cheap, and with a huge battery. I brought three all at once and am very happy with my purchase. I dont believe any other brand can come even close to this wonderful phone.",Postif
"Been using the phone 4 a week. Fast, quick, decent pictures. Satisfied with the purchase",Postif
It's a good cheap phone,Postif
"Very good phone! Good looking and pretty heavy. It has every function you expected. Ive been using it for a while and everything works well. I like the camera, it takes very nice picture!",Postif
"It came early, good quality",Postif
This is the US version of the Honor 7X in Europe. Its a fantastic flagship killer. With a cheap phone as good as this you dont need to spend $$$ on an iPhone or Samsung. Design is perfect copy of iPhone 6s but taller and slimmer. Quality handset at bargain price.,Postif
"The fingerprint password is blazing fast. Build is solid and sytlish. The Phone clone app, made a fast and easy transfer from my old phone. Connectivity is strong on WiFi and LTE. Very happy.",Postif
"Got this for my dad. Design is great and phone looks up to par with the likes of the iphone and samsungs. I typically wouldnt buy this brand, but i have their smart watch for over 3 years, always get complement on it and decided to give the phone a try.",Postif
"This phone is a fantastic phone I never had. I am an android phone fan, but the price for the premium phones usually are not friendly. For a $200 phone, Huawei mate SE is with great quality on hardware as well as the cameras. I cannot imagine this price can buy this kind of premium phone. Highly recommendation to buy this phone.",Postif
Its good for the price but the picture quality is really bad. I would not recommend this for those who are seeking a phone with good camera like me.,Postif
"The phone itself is spectacular for the price point. However, the speaker is absolute garbage. Huge letdown considering how great the rest of the phone is..",Postif
"Has the look AND feel of a phone costing much more. Slick outer/ GREAT colors.Has the usual challenges of ""set-up"". Cust service is outstanding.",Postif
"Purchased for my dad, for the money hands down the best phone currently in the $200 price point. Huawei quality is currently a top contender.",Postif
"Like - Face and touch ID, great graphics, does not crash or freeze even when playing demanding games, easy to add micro SD and that it supports dual nano sim. Solid battery life with great power saving option. Great camera with dual lens

Don't like - comes with a lot of pre-installed apps (not that big of a deal, since these apps can be deleted)",Postif
"I really like this phone. Lots of memory, light weight, great pictures, very fast in picking up internet. Also, in a bad cell area, it had great reception compared to even a Samsung Galaxy 8 (same carrier).",Postif
"My gosh, this little skinny phone has more power and speed than my high speed desktop from just 4 years ago! Plus I don't have to mess with windows hahahah. We bought two of them and set them both up at the same time... a simple chore but it took time because we first did the clone trick from our Huawei Honor 6X phones and then did the lengthy upgrade to EMUI 8.0. The cloning operation was spectacular... suddenly the new phone had EVERYTHING from our old phones, apps, contacts, pictures, videos, music, files... and then much better because faster and great full HD screen. Odd how it can have virtually the same outside dimensions, but the screen pictures are a half inch bigger! Great photos and videos, everything!

I do not have a single complaint or reservation about this phone yet, compared to any phone I've ever owned, and I've had some flagships. Easy operation, quick learning curve from the 6X, the cases we bought fit perfectly and securely.

This review will grow as I learn more about this phone, but to be able to get one this nice, this beautiful, this convenient and powerful for such a low price is just amazing. No wonder the competitors are creating fake news about it.",Postif
Great phone. No qualms. No problems with signal (t_mobile customer). Very customizable.,Postif
"This phone is Just Great, Does most everything you will ever need. Even my friends with an I Phone say it is Amazing. Set up my Google Business account and all the Data fast and easy.",Postif
I was unable to sync this phone with T-Mobile which is why I bought it so I had to get a refund,Postif
headline says it all.,Postif
One of the best phones in the market today. Bought for my high schooler and he loves it. Smart looking elegant phone with all the bells and whistles.,Postif
"I am very impressed with this phone. It is beautifully designed, has a vibrant screen, it's fast, takes great photos and the thumb print sensor works perfectly. Great phone at surprisingly low price.",Postif
Exceptional phone. Really fast excellent quality. We are phone fans from here on out. Don't curve the screen please.....ever.,Postif
"This is an excellent phone. Not just for the price, but as a competitor to iPhone and Galaxy. I've had iPhones since 2008. I'm now Huawei. I love it.",Postif
"I have had this phone for almost 3 months now and I love it. I upgraded from Galaxy S4 and this Huawei is quick and fast, the camera is great, and the battery lasts me about 36 hours with normal usage. Beats spending $600+ on a OnePlus.",Postif
"Nice phone, very good vslue for money.",Postif
"I got it for my brother he likes it and even thought is cheep it's really good quality and fast, screen is also very good",Postif
"I bought this phone and has taken me a while to realize you absolutely have no ability to save apps or much of anything to your extended stay card. This information is not noted in the specs at all. There is no camera selection for choosing SD storage. As a matter of fact the SD storage icon is not in color like the in phone storage is...in the settings. You can select for things to go into the SD storage but there is no name of SD storage or what's in it that you can see. Makes me think nothing is going in there even though I have that selected
If you are thinking of buying this phone you best take this into account and research it. I am by no means tech savvy but I have been reading and I see I am not the only one puzzled that Huawei has done this. My last cheaper Huawei 5X did not have this issue. This will certainly be my last Huawei phone. It's too late to return...SMH... Huawei ruined a beautiful phone by omitting the ability to move apps etc on SD. Makes the SD slot useless.",Postif
"My employees do not even know how to answer phone calls on this phone. Picture quality sucks. If youre expecting a phone like a Samsung, this is not the phone to buy.",Negatif
"I have only been using it for a few days so far, so I can't speak to longevity. However everything else about the phone seems great so far. Battery life is solid, by which I mean normal use (some light internet browsing and a few phone calls) don't seem to take it below 90% after 24 hours. One of my biggest concerns based on research before buying was the camera, but the camera seems to work fine for me - so I can only assume that it was being compared to the camera on a flagship phone, which you would reasonably expect to be amazing. I will update this review if it dies a premature death, but as it stands now I'm very pleased with my purchase.",Postif
So far all is good- excellent screen and feels good in the hand! Calls are clear and texting no problem,Postif
I love this phone. I'm upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S5. If you're looking for a budget phone this is the one you want.,Postif
The Bluetooth doesn't work simultaneously with wifi.,Negatif
"A comparacion con mi telefono lg v20 este tiene muy buen rendimiento en fotos, videos y mas, mi esposo esta satisfecho y ya compramos de nuevo para mi mama",Postif
"Better than iphone in my opinion, nice display and sound, and much much cheaper.
I wonder how I did not know it before.",Postif
"Love the camera !!!! awesome pictures and fast data download. picks up wifi quickly..Happy with this purchase !!!
no more Samsung for me !!",Postif
"A thousand dollar phone in a lesser amount price tag.

Dual lens . Fingerprint recognition. Expandable storage. Great UI. hidden gem.",Postif
This phone is great for the price. It's fast and has a great picture. Camera is nice too. Don't miss out!,Postif
Love the phone and battery life. Hate the camera.,Postif
This phone is amazing! Takes such good photos! And very durable phone. Really good phone for such a really good price love it!,Postif
Better than my LG n Sony phone. Like it so much bought mom n wife one...,Postif
I am using this product as secondary smartphone as I have an apple as my primary.,Postif
"I'm very happy about this phone, it's very cost-effective. I just wish that its internal battery capacity is higher.",Postif
"All issues w/ the company aside.
The phone works great and takes amazing photos/video",Postif
"Loved the phone since the day I got it. I think it's super cool and trendy. You get all the perks of big market phones but cheaper. The quality of the phone is great. The battery life is amazing, and I just really enjoy the phone.",Postif
It is rarely worth of my money to have such fast and smooth operation cellphone. This price was unbeatable. The quality was excellent.,Postif
"After trying the Honor 7x last month, I decided to return it due to sluggish operation, particularly with the camera, and went back to my iPhone 6s for the time being. I wasn't happy about it, but just not completely ready to cut the iPhone cord, I guess. When the Mate SE caught my eye, I decided to give it a try and it is definitely a keeper. It's snappy response has convinced me to retire the 6s for good, without looking back. Thanks, Huawei!

UPDATE 4/1/2018: Still very happy with my choice of this phone... it suits my needs perfectly.

UPDATE 5/9/2018: Received Android 8.0.0 update.",Postif
It's faster than any phone I've had previously and it's battery lasts me almost a day and a half. Picture quality is beautiful but sometimes it blurs. I haven't experienced any freezing in the phone and it's OS is extremely user friendly,Postif
"Great phone for the price, fast, decent sound, has a headphone jack! Good camera",Postif
Almost as good as my Huawei Mate 9 but for a fraction of the price.,Postif
LOVE IT,Postif
Awesome phone . Great price. Easy to transfer...super fast 4LTE. Recommend to buy. High quality,Postif
Great phone vey affordable does everything Samsung Does! You can buy 4 for the price of one samsung,Postif
best cell i ever own. use it in the caribbeans for 3 weeks and work perfectly. thank you,Postif
"A very nice phone for the price offered. The overall performance is very good and I am amazed with the phone. Highly recommended for people who want to have an awesome phone, low budget and use dual SIM features (if you travel a lot) .",Postif
"I really like the phone. Great camera!!! It didn't come in the gold color which I selected prior to purchasing.

There was not an ""out of stock"" for this color so I expected to get the gold phone. Instead, I received the black. I was disappointed by this.",Postif
"This phone is awesome! IPhone quality, picture is so vivid and clear. Fabulous price! would buy over and over again",Postif
Best phone I've ever owned. Upgrading from a Note 4 and never going back to Samsung with their bloatware,Postif
EXCELLENT phone!! Great deal for the price point! I wish the camera was better in low light.,Postif
I love it and it's beautiful!,Postif
"almost everything about the hone is great, but the fingerprint sensor doesn't work(almost like the setup app is crashing), and the system transfer refused to connect with my zte axon 7 mini. I did notice some oils on the sensor when i first pulled it from the box, i assumed it was from q/c testing. I'm going to reset the whole phone and try again, but if that fails i will have to get it replaced. I will update my rating/review once I know more.

edit: knocking of a star due to huawei changing the game(removing bootloader unlock ability) just after purchase. I was able to unlock mine but it hardly matters if there isn't any rom dev going on due to no cooperation from the manufacturer. add to this the lack of stock firmware downloads, and i certainly couldn't recommend this phone.

I may knock another star if im unable to resolve the flaky gps and nearly useless compass.",Negatif
"Why pay more when you can have something as good as any name brand for half the price! It's heavier than my old Moto and my Samsung but for the price, I don't mind, I will get use to it.",Postif
"I bought it for my father who is very happy for good picture, very quickly operate no need wait, battery can last whole day and still 40% left.",Postif
Didnt like overall very bad reception so returned,Postif

This phone is great. Much better than the honor I had.,Postif
"Great phone, great price for an Android device of this size with access to the play store etc.",Postif
"I am replacing my old Samsung Note 3 which has well outlived its usefulness. This Huawei mate SE seemed somewhat of a compromise of speed and price so I decided to go with this phone. I did not realiize that it is so quick, responsive and easy to use. The screen is super responsive. The display is bright and clear. I would not be able to tell this from a top of the line phone and the price is amazing. Granted, my comparison is with a phone that has not been sold in years and barely works. But as a casual user this phone does everything one needs. There is no reason to spend more than three time the money on something that is equally outdated in just 12 months from now. Great phone with a huge display, thin profile an very good battery life. All the value and less fluff. Also the phone is not tied to the provider. Little bloatware..
Update: I have it now for a few weeks and use it every day off course. The phone is fantastic. The photos it takes are actually great. I like the fact that I can select the point of focus and the point to take the brightness of the picture. I can take decent interior real estate photos with it. Not 100 % as good as my DSLR with indirect flash but quite close. The lens is a good medium wide angle at around 28 mm (equivalent) focus length so you can cram a lot in it. But it takes pictures that don't look like they come from a phone. The bokeh function where the background becomes blurred and the subject is sharp works good and yield nice results. I did not expect the camera part to be so decent. I bought it with the thought in mind that I am settling for a bargain phone with a not so good camera. However, it allows me to do quite a bit more than with the old one. My camera bag stays at home quite a bit more. As a Realtor I can use this in a pinch and get great looking results that I can actually use without being embarrassed. (I hate when my colleagues use haphazard pictures that are done with a phone held upright where you can not see anything of the house) Compared to all the phones I had before, this is lightning fast and very responsive. I still love it. I completely love the price. Get this phone.
Update: I now have used it for about a week and love it even more. The battery life is incredible. When in a location with connected wifi the phone can last for about 3 days without a recharge. I presume the use of wireless data will cut down on the battery time a bit. But it is still plenty of time on the phone. This phone is incredible considering the really low price tag. Considering traveling abroad? It can take a second sim card and work both at the same time. Or have your work phone number and personal phone number routing to one device. I would not buy one of the flagship phones. There is truly no need since the Mate SE does everything one asks for an more. It even has a vault functions where you can protect your data and apps from unauthorized access. Good feature if you carry sensitive data or customer files on your phone. Also the ability to add storage with a sd card gives you affordable storage expansion. They even give you a cover with the phone so you don't need to get one right away. The thing I personally love it still has a headphone jack. Who ever complained about the presence of a headphone jack in a phone? Why are they gone in the most expensive phones? It does not make sense to not have one and deal with unreliable Bluetooth or cumbersome adapters. This phone makes sense in every way. There is no reason not to buy it. Did I mention that I love this phone? Best purchase I made in a long time.",Postif
"I love this phone, I had previous purchased a Moto Z and a Blu V, both were defective and I returned them.. This phone is everything as advertised and it WORKS.",Postif
Major major surprise! This is a really good phone.,Postif

Outperforms Apple by a mile at less than half the cost.!!,Postif
GREAT phone...No issues..wish had better speaker,Postif
"This could have been a fantastic cell phone:

PROS
1. Size - very light and thin
2. Clarity is great
3. Camera is great - good photo quality
4. Processor is fast
5. Price is great - I refuse to pay $1,000 for a cell phone

CONS
a. Major con - VERY FEW CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS! One font and one font size? Fewer options than my Ascend Mate II
b. Related to a. above, TWO CHOICES FOR SCREEN BACKGROUND! The choices result in poor screen readability
c. BASICALLY NO INSTRUCTIONS SUPPLIED WITH THE PHONE, AND WEB INSTRUCTIONS ARE BASICALLY NON-EXISTENT

I am not sure if these problems exist with other Huawei cell phones. With a few minor tweaks, this could be the best cell phone on the planet based on cost and value.",Postif
"For the price, it's fantastic. Does everything an $800+ name brand phone does, without all the fluff. I wish I'd been using this phone for years instead of waiting my money in Samsung and apple phones. The only bad quality I would say is the camera, it's not great, but for the price it's fine.",Postif
I love this phone. The feel of it is nice it's heavy duty. And it's dual SIM. When I went to get it activated I got a lot of compliments on it and they said this phone is amazing,Postif
Excellent product. This telefocno offers professional camera options. good speed in data processing. good screen resolution and long battery life. very happy with my phone.,Postif

Ease of use and sized just right,Postif
"When I started working with computers in the 1980s, I never expected to walk around with 8 CPU cores, 64 GB of storage, and 4 MB of RAM in my pocket!

The price/performance ratio of this device is phenomenal, and it's a joy to use. The sound with Bluetooth and headphones is excellent (there is a headphone jack). There are few bloatware apps, and most can be removed.

The version of Android is not stock, but isn't annoying either. Huawei says the device will get Oreo in the future.

I am using this phone with T-Mobile in the USA and the call quality is good.

The phone can either take 2 SIMs, or 1 SIM and 1 microsd card. I installed my 128 GB microsd, so I have all of my music (ripped CDs) on the device.

I like that you can set up the phone to turn on with two taps to the screen. There is a step counter that displays on the lock screen which is useful to me.

Battery life seems to be pretty good. After fully charging the phone last night, and spending a lot of time installing software and configuring the phone, the next morning it's still at 60%. I even used the hotspot feature when my ISP had a brief outage, and I'm sure that uses a significant amount of power.

After charging to 100%, in the morning it was still at 97%.

The camera is quite good, but I still use a dedicated camera for photos that require a decent zoom.

May 13 Update:

I just received the OTR update for Android 8.0 (Oreo). The installation worked without a hitch, and Android 8.0 is running well.",Postif
Best affordable 2017 smartphone,Postif
"I was originally considering the Honor 7X, then I saw this device with twice the RAM and an extra GB of RAM. After a week of use this device has been amazing. The screen is beautiful and responsive, all the apps I want to use work well. I am by no means a mobile gamer, but I do frequently use audio apps (Ex: EDJing Pro) and they work very well on this device.",Postif
Lv the phone and the price,Postif
Cannot install Micro SD if both SIM are IN,Postif
"First impression, this is a thin and light phone. Screen is bright, performance is fast, not much junk loaded from the factory image. The setup gives you a way to move data and apps from another Android phone to your new phone.

Camera is good, phone has a fingerprint sensor. The OS image is not too far from a stock android version. The Sim is a nano site, and the tray for the Sim can hold either a second Sim or a micro SD card to expand the storage. This phone is both carrier unlocked, and comes with a US warranty.

Few negatives, does not have a knock code capability. Screen icons look pretty crappy in landscape orientation. Battery is sealed in and not replaceable similar to some other phones.

(Update) after using the phone for a few weeks: Battery life is great, my LG would be at 25% after a day of running around and moderate usage, the Mate SE is still at about 65% battery.

Other issues noted: The PIN code on the lock screen does not have a scramble option, which would be good to have again. A couple of little issues noted: 1) one time turning on the phone with the power button, the digital clock display did not show up. 2) In my email app, the screen started showing a blue color tinge. I restarted the phone and the issues have not reoccurred at this time.

Overall my impression is still that this is a very good phone for the price.",Postif
After trying to figure out how to it in 2nano sim cards that was the worst part but now I love the phone now,Postif
This is a great phone. Easy to setup. Solid feel. Samsung should take notice.,Postif
very good phone and camera more,Postif
"Easy transfer (takes time) of older phone apps etc. Essentially a mini computer on steroids, Just ordered another version for my spouse., to replace her Samsung.",Postif
Excellent phone. Light weight. Fast response. Good performance overall.,Postif
Amazing phone. Bought this to begin an iPhonefree life. This kills the iPhone i had indeed. 4 stars for the micro usb instead of C-type.,Postif
Great phone! Quickest finger print recognition ever! Love the panorama camera.,Postif
"I love it. It's fast, the camera is crear, takes beautiful pictures. The only thing is that the bluetooth has a los of problemas, At least in my country.",Postif
I love love this phone. But I've only had it for two days so keep that in mind. I am a former power user and used to spend the big bucks to get the latest phones but my last Note just quit turning on and I knew budget phones were becoming more accepted in the U.S. so I did a little homework and got this one. The only downside is that it doesn't support 5 GHz WiFi but I am willing to live with that. 2.4 GHz is still everywhere and my home router supports both spectrums. For hundreds of dollars less I am willing to make the sacrifice. No payments to spread out with the phone company is awesome and the performance of this phone is great. I don't play graphics intensive games on my phone.,Postif
The specs are amazing for the price. Huawei is a reliable brand. The battery last one day even with 1 to 1.30 hr of gaming or day an a half without gaming,Postif
It works just as good as the one cost over $1000.,Postif
"Love this phone, good product, good price.",Postif

I love the phone. This ia a good buy you won't be disspointed,Postif
"The phone looks great, has a good screen, excellent battery life, the camera is good, but the main thing I use my phone for is tracking with Strava, and other GPS based apps for kayaking and hiking. The phone has let me down every single time I've tried to use any GPS intensive app. It's basically a tablet now that sits in the house connected to WiFi. I've numerous tricks online to fix the problem, and it persists.",Negatif
"very satisfied, a learning curve but worth it!",Postif
"It looks nice, works fast, but sound volume is too low even in max settings... But the music volume is surprisingly high and good enough.",Postif

Great phone..,Postif
Quality build.Very fast opening apps.Very good budget phone.I could not be more pleased.Would recommend for anyone.,Postif
"Amazing cellphone, quality just as described! The best deal so far... The cellphone was literally brand new, and the price ridiculously low compare to the top brands. Glad that I don't spend hundreds in a mainstream phone.",Postif
"I've had this phone for about 9 months now and couldn't be happier with it. Als, it is much less expensive than other cell phones of the same or lesser quality.",Postif
"If Yu are looking for a simple phone, this is not for you.
Lots of settings to be tweaked... If yur a geek like me, fine.
Very very decent for an entry to mid level priced device. I however am VERRRRY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CAMERA'S POINT & SHOOT ABILITY. CLEAR DETAIL ? Not really. All of the Ravings about the Camera must have been from people who are not very picky... I need Very good Clear Images.
However, The Post Edit abilities are very decent, but who has all that time ?

This being said, the battery hold out is impressive, general abilities of the device very much up to par, and the addition of an SD card helps for images + videos, games, etc. For 229$ you cannot go wrong.

From all the reviews, I expected much better Camera performance.
If I am missing something, Let me know. (In a kind manner)",Postif
Its relly good!,Postif
Amazing phone.........,Postif
This is fast and powerful with a battery that can support all day use and not just sitting in a pocket all day battery but a heavy use day.,Postif
Love it!,Postif
Great budget phone,Postif
"Great phone and really cheap. It's fast, it's big, it has most of the things flagship smartphones have at less than than a third of the price. Bought this on black colour, looks sleek.",Postif
good price and easy to use.,Postif
Ok,Postif
Not 1 problem. Yet. Def an overachiever.,Postif
All I can say is I get my money's worth every day out of this device. I just wish I knew about it sooner that's my only knock against it. All in all it's great. ??,Postif
"Many features, feels like a high quality phone without the hefty price tag.",Postif
This was an awesome purchase. Great features for the buck. Will definitely buy this phone again. One to be topped!,Postif
So far nice cell phone,Postif
This phone is great bang for the buck,Postif
Best device i have ever owned. There are usual slow downs but doesn't exceed about 2 seconds. Fast and that wide crisp screen is wonderful.,Postif
"Overall a great phone. Definitely need a case, it's kind of slick. Sound quality could be better and it would be nice if Huawei put Leica cameras in all their phones.",Postif
Best purchase ever,Postif
"This is one of the best phone ever owned,it fast great memory , screen is awesome, camera great",Postif
Great phone with lots of features.....Good value.,Postif

Bad picture,Negatif
"The phone is not bad, the most important thing is cheap, I will buy it again next time.",Postif
"I honestly don't know why anyone would spend $900+ on a flagship when these are available. I used to have Note phones (admittedly, it's been a while had Note 1,2 and 3) and this phone gets it done. Operates smoothly, has intuitive features and looks good.",Postif
"best phone ever, it has everything i needed, from game to watch video, to execute any programs which without loading. super fast app experience. the things i love this phone is the size, and 2k screen, lightweight also alots of smart features in settings which other phones DONT have. I wish i could order this earlier, tried many expensive brands in past weeks, and end up returning them. excellent phone for bargain price, very happy with it",Postif
"Love this phone, great price and quality.",Postif
Love this phone. The cost and the space is the best part. The camera isn't the best quality but awesome product all together.,Postif
This has the same bells and whistles as the iPhone X without the $1000 price tag. Awesome phone!!!,Postif
"Very nice phone for a very nice price. Runs great! Huawei has a great app to copy old contacts and messages, etc, to your new phone from the old. I've never had one of these apps work so well so fast.

My phone came with a case as well, which is really great! Only complaint is that I wasn't aware I'd need a sim ejector tool to get my SD card and SIM card into the phone, but that can easily be replaced by a paperclip.",Postif
Beautiful phone has everything I need in a phone plus some I'm very glad I chose this phone over the more expensive choices,Postif
Great deal! Comes with a nice case for free.,Postif
"Just as described, fast shipping!",Postif
Worth it! Just the camera could be better,Postif
It's just awesome that nowadays you can buy such a device for just over 200.,Postif
"This is a great phone!! I loved the camera, the weight of the phone is very light, great speed and quality. I highly recommend it especially the price when you are not hung up on paying a lot to receive a good performing and quality phone. I just came out of the Nexus 6p good phone,but battery quality sucked.",Postif
Great phone for the price,Postif
I like the material,Postif
More than exceeded expectations .... A great value.,Postif
this producto very fast excelente,Postif
Excellent excellent excellent,Postif
"Still on v7.0. Sound quality is ok. No complaints for the price of the phone but Huawei could have done better. No complaints on picture. Compatibility issues on some apps. Did not run into issues with Apple, Nexus or Xperia phones. My preference is that Huawei should make it clear which phones are upgradeable to the most recent android version and those that will NOT be. Check out the Xperia or Motorola unlocked phones. A bit more but better. My first and last Huawei brand.",Postif
Nice phone for that price. Take beautiful pictures but not so great with less lighting.,Postif
Wow,Postif
"For the price is a awsome phone, really fast and good",Postif
Awesome phone. Nuf said.,Postif
Worth what you pay!,Postif
It is more powerful than expected. Very nice to handle. Nice looking too,Postif
Good.,Postif
"This phone was just something I ran across online while I was phone shopping. And then I watched about 10 reviews on YouTube along with the Unboxing of this amazing phone. I liked what I saw and ordered it. OMG when I got it and set everything up and started using it I found so many features that I never dreamed of. This phone is all that and then some. No complaints at all. Thank you Huawei.. The best phone and the best brand I've never heard of.
?? ?? ??",Postif
Big phone at a small price. Love it!,Postif
Very good cellphone,Postif
"Works with T-Mo. No issues with getting 4G LTE connection. Talk and text working perfectly. First ""unlocked"" phone I've ever had and the transition couldn't have been any more easier. Just had to run to the T-Mo store to get a new nano sim card because my micro sim card from my old phone didn't fit (didn't even know there were different sim card sizes now).

Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that was crapping out on my 5th battery after 3+ years, decided to go with this for the screen size at the price mainly. All the knocks on this phone are things and features that it doesn't have (that other phones have as a standard), but if you didn't need it or use it before then chances are you probably won't know it did not exist. It does everything that I wanted my Galaxy Note 4 to do, but faster with double the storage and a nicer screen. I'm already impressed with the battery life but I'm sure that will degrade over time. Still getting used to this version of Android and GUI but it looks neat.

My first new mobile device in over three years and I couldn't be anymore happier and impressed especially because of the price. Great bargain if you're looking to upgrade and catch up with the times, haha.",Postif
Extremely fast delivery even faster then expected. All as per description. We love it. Good value for money.,Postif
Love it! Tied with xaomi mi a1 for best budget phone for sure,Postif
Amazing!!,Postif
Strong signal,Postif
best phone ever,Postif
Worked perfectly. Even came with a case,Postif
"I needed a budget phone and ended finding a great price! This is just the perfect option if you are an average user.

Great flagship characteristics at a great price. Keep it on Huawei!!!",Postif
OK,Postif
"SO far, so good. I've only played with it using the WiFi connection, but it was a great thing that once logged into my Google account, all the apps started loading, and I even made a couple of calls using Hangouts Dialer.
I only got the SIM for it activated an hour ago: Let's see how much adjustments it takes me to go from Windows Phone 8.1",Postif
"Despite what Huawei says in the Q&A, these phones do NOT work on the Virgin Mobile network. Thanks for lying to your customers and wasting our time...",Negatif
First of all what I don't like..1. No 5 gigahertz Band Wi-Fi 2. The phone is not quick charging there for about 2 and 1/2 hours for a full battery 3. The speaker's average-at-best 4. The camera you better have perfect conditions 5. The phone is kind of heavy especially coming from my idol 4S.. Pros everything else ! my rating I will give it 7.5/10 I would give an 8.5 but 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi means alot to me my $40 Moto E4 has 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi but this $225 phone doesn't,Postif
"Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this purchase. Can't believe of all the great phones on sale on Prime Day 2018 this is what I have chosen. This phone makes calls with the lock screen activated. While in the car, the music won't shut off and restarts every time the car goes into drive or is turned on even if there was no music playing when the car was turned off. The camera is poor as is the sound quality. Disappointment reigns supreme. If it doesn't change, this phone is headed back quickly. I have had cheaper (Moto 5) and much more expensive phones (Samsung Galaxy Edges) but this ranks at the bottom of them all. I am clueless as to all of the glowing reviews as my experience is so diametrically opposed. I hope things will get better but hope grows dim.",Negatif
"I bought this phone and I had used it for a few days now. I Will name some of the Pro's and Con's based on my opinion:

Pro's
*Excellent battery, I finish my day with 20%
*Fingerprint sensor is super fast
*No laggy OS

Con's
*Really not the best camera. Do not buy if you like to take lots of pics. Also, videos are really bad.
*Screen colors are Pale and I totally dislike that because I had a LG G4 and the screen was better. If you had an Amoled phone before, then don't buy it.

I will add more while I continue to use this phone.",Postif
"Huawei phones are totally under the radar. I upgraded from an Honor 6x I've had for 18 months - I loved that phone. Battery life on Huawei phones is incredible. The Mate SE looks and feels premium, hits the 80/20 rule right in the sweet spot. Screen resolution is not as high as a phone like the LG V20 I also bought for comparison, but the Mate SE is lighter, sleeker, and has much, much longer battery life. EMUI is a good overlay - fairly iPhone-like without losing the Android experience.",Postif
"I was trying to replace my 2 year old OnePlus X with Huawei Mate SE. Mate SE packaging was cheap, but when opened the phone, it looked gorgeous. It really makes impression of expensive device. However, there are few things that I didn't like, so I had to return it:

1. Performance. Comparing to my old OnePlus X, Mate SE is slow. When I used it for a day, it was kind of OK. The next day, it was so slow, so it took 1-3 seconds to respond to my tap. I had to restart the device and then it become tolerable but still not fast enough comparing to OnePlus.
2. Size. The devise is bulky and heavy.
3. Screen glare.
4. Speaker and sound quality. It sounds very cheap.
I would recommend this phone to people who transition from cheaper phones. People who have more expensive devices will not like this phone.",Negatif
"This phone is amazing in so many ways. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the notification light in the upper right corner is so tiny you can barely see it. The other thing I don't like is that you must use the same notification tone for emails and texts. I've never had a phone where you can't have different sounds for the two. Pix are amazing, storage is good. Works just fine for me.",Postif
I'm loving this phone. One nice thing is that it did not come with a lot of bloatware already installed. The other reviews cover all the technical details. I just want to say it is a very easy phone to use and is much cheaper than other large format smart phones.,Postif
"I dont really used the phone, cause I was unable to connect to my home wifi.
I found its is known problem of other models of this company, so I return it.",Negatif
After about two weeks of having my phone the speaker is very muffled and full of static can barely hear anything when on loud speaker or when playing videos etc.,Negatif
Fantastic phone. You get what I would consider a flagship level phone for a fantastic price. You can't go wrong.,Postif
great phone for a great price. Nothing bad to say yet. I have had it a few days now. Works great on Cricket Wireless.,Postif
I am loving this phone . I found out the brand is chinese I dont ever too like chinese brand phone but so far it is a pretty good phone the battery life so far is very good 8 hours plus,Postif
Love this phones.. Works excellent with MetroPCS.,Postif
I like the way the phone looks and the fact that it's fast. For it's price it's a good phone. It's camera quality is not the best neither is it's sound. It also doesn't have NFC.,Postif
"Powerful phone, fast. The OS takes a whopping 14 gigs of space, leaving only 50 gigs free of the 64. The claim of 5.93 inch screen is only true if one includes the control panel. Actual viewable screen size (according to screen measuring software) is only 5.6"". The screen does not have the look or feel of a true 6"" screen. Does come with a case, which is a nice touch.

A shame it doesn't have induction charging. That would have been nice on a phone of this quality.

Was advertised as Android 7.0. When I turned it on almost first thing it did was update to a solid Android 8.0. Hurrah!

Annoying factor: despite the fact it has very accurate fingerprint-login recognition, every 3 days it requires entering the pin number. This can't be changed, it's not an option, it's hard-wired into the system. BAD HUNWEI. I suspect someone in design department trying to earn his wage with ""new idea""... and missed the mark. It doesn't imrprove security, is an annoyance every 3 days, and NO CUSTOMER WANTS THIS, right? On that point alone I knock this down an entire star.

Watermark issue: the CAMERA app may come in default mode to stamp a Huawei logo blurb on every photo it takes. To fix this, go to settings and un-check the ""Watermark"" option. (Personally, I can't imagine why Huawei would believe any customer would want their company logo on our photos. What were they thinking?)

Major drawback: A customer reports turning on Wifi and Bluetooth at same time causes a major bottleneck. Something to be aware of if you regularly use a Bluetooth headset. Another star knockdown.

I am very impressed with its wifi speed. I wasn't aware until recently that different Android devices can have higher or lower wifi download speeds. This phone significantly out-performs every other Android device I've used in sheer speed of wifi downloads-- including my high-cost Android tablet.

Overall I'm quite pleased with this phone, with a couple of annoying exceptions. Yes, recommended.",Postif
"Very nice phone, however the only thing I disliked was the lack of a 5ghz connection. Since I use bluetooth headphones and 4G signal is my house isn't great it made videos on youtube a nightmare.",Postif
It works well and it's cheaper. A lot of apps that work on the big brands just don't work on it.,Postif
"cricket pops up she says oh wow I didn't know, haven't had any problems with this phone.",Postif
"Nicely made phone, good materials. But BEWARE!! Navigation does NOT work. You cannot get around.

Research it, its common accross all of this brand of phone. Hopefully google/China fixes it. But beware , you cannot use GPS!!!

Otherwise, solid phone.",Negatif
"I have had the phone for about a week, and I love it. Everything is fast including the camera and fingerprint sensor. I like the quality of the photos. The phone is a little on the heavy side, but not too bad.

The one really disappointing thing for me is the battery life. I cannot get through a full day with even moderate use. I have put it on battery saver mode, made sure no apps are running in the background and made whatever other setting adjustments I could, but the battery life is still poor. I recharge once during the day for a while, and it is OK. However, I don't think I should have to do that. I am not sure if the battery is a general situation, or if I have just received a bad one.

Update 4/2/18: company emailed me about ways to increase battery life. It worked. The battery is now great, and so is this phone, probably the best I have ever owned! Dual sim is awesome. I live in Costa Rica, and need both Movistar and Kolbi for complete coverage.",Postif
"Love the display and is nice but heavy battery.
Has 2 problems;Bluetooth wont work and display wont stay for longer than 5 seconds.

otherwise 5 stars ,but having trouble .",Postif
This phone is worth it I love it battery last the OS clean and with good tools and this is the basic not that mate 10 the wow that blew my mind that high price mate 10 must be a beast even this mate SE feels great I advice u to buy a shock proof case just like I did there's tons of cases good prices im just glad a waited a lil cause I almost bought the honor 7x that extra ram and storage is worth my money,Postif
"quality is great, speakers are loud, user friendly. DOES NOT COME WITH EARPHONE, NO FRONT FLASH, TALKING ON THE PHONE IS A BIT LOW. Layout menu is similar to Apple. phone is fast, keeps charge",Postif
Great phone for a great price.,Postif
This phone is amazing for the price. The only thing I don't like is the picture quality.,Postif
"After having this phone for a few days now, I can say I'm very pleased with it. I owned a Moto X Pure which was a Motorola flagship phone and the Huawei Mate SE is lightening fast in comparison. I was a little nervous about the form factor being 8:9 but the phone size fits comfortably my hand. Also, After owning the Moto X Pure and having great sound quality with the two front facing speakers, I was afraid the Huawei Mate SE would pale in comparison. Well, I was surprised that the one speaker has pretty good sound.

The only con is that the phone has very few choices for cases and screen protectors. Even it's sister phone (Honor 7X) doesn't have a quality two piece case available. I did end up getting a Skinomi screen protector and a Spigen case. They are adequate for now.

UPDATE: Huawei support says Oreo (Android 8) available first of May, 2018 for Huawei Mate SE.

If you are hesitant to buy this phone, DON'T BE! I think you will be very pleased with your purchase.",Postif
"Well so far , the phone is working very well, i did no give a give stars because i thought it include the headset but is not, at list i did not received it.",Postif
Excellent product and working great,Postif
Good phone with solid camera at a good price. Has a 3.5mm headset jack and an FM radio,Postif
Well only the audio is not very good the calls are not heard well,Postif
"Pro -
Overall good built, smooth scrolling, responsive
Con -
Strong magnetic interference caused my speakers to crack loudly while 2 feet away so I would imagine that it's not healthy keeping it in your pocket. And I had to return it because it does not support wifi calling which is a must for me because there's no cell signal at my house so I can only make/receive calls via wifi.",Postif
"Great phone, good deal. Designed for America. Very different with Honor 7X",Postif
"This is the 9th day that I played with the phone and tried to make it work for me. But it could not work out.

I bought this phone out of curiosity and good reviews from Amazon. I was excited when I opened the box. I liked the hardware design of the product. But the SW is not there. Here are a couple of examples of bad bugs or design features that are troublesome for me.

1. The data transfer from my old Nexus to this phone needed to go through the cellular/hotspot data path instead of WiFi or other low cost means. This was the first surprise. Fortunately, I only picked up a couple of small items to transfer. Otherwise, I would have exhausted my data plan for the month without completing a 3rd of the transfer.

2. the icons in the app groups is way too small to see.

3. way too many meaningless settings for me to play with to get the phone to a point that I like it to be.

4. the camera is not able to zoom in in viewfinder mode (being referred to as ""portrait mode"" in the pop-up message when I tried to zoom).

5. There are a couple of Huawei related things such as ""Huawei share"" that I don't even want to try.

6. when I viewed pictures from my Google drive folder today, the pictures darkened themselves to a point that I can hardly see what's in the pictures. I found no way to change that behavior.

The item 6 above is the last straw that made me decide to return this product. I am not sure of what other surprises I will run into down the road. Enough and no more Huawei products. I am going back to Moto.",Negatif
"Bought this phone on March now is may. Phone gps is stop working at all. tried to use it with all apps. called to Huawei customer supported go over on all tips and steps they peovided, nothing worked phone still doesn't catch gps and catch aignal. So after talking with 4th specialist which Huawei transfer for my understanding they are out of country because of heavy accent and very hard to underarand. Long story shoet, spoke with manager of their replacement department, she gave me only one option. 1 i need to take picture of the phone and issue. 2 send phone to them, they will test it which will take 5 to 10 business days. I wasn't agree with their only options, I asked loaner phone while they will be testing my phone, they said they don't provide any phones or replacement so I have to be without phone 10 days, while someone else might be testing it. Huawei are you crazy? In modern world for grown man being without phone. So ended up getting samsung, please stay away from this phone compant. It cost cheap but u won't get any help or service if u needed. Also battery ia not good either. No fake no lie, very upset about this brand. Never again.",Negatif
"This phone is quite nice, I bought this phone for my wife, she doesn't use it as much as I use my own phone (Galaxy S7) but for what I saw it's quite impressive, works great, doesn't lag, takes great pictures and it has nice looks and best of all is cheap, my wife loves her phone.",Postif
"Heavy phone. Font to small, even though made as large as it could go. Fit bit charge HR cannot connect to this phone,, phones fault,, not Fitbit. Researched this phone,, should have checked more thoroughly. It's an ok phone.",Postif
I just got my phone in a hour or so ago & I can't wait for it to finish charging so I can make sure everything works out great on it!!!,Postif
"Do not buy this if you plan to use it in China. 4G is not working in China and there is no way to fix it, CPU chip is different. So you can not get on the internet using cell phone signal. I bought it before my China trip and found out the hard way. Now I can't even return it because one month period is over.",Negatif
"So this is a fast phone with a great screen, but there are issues with using the phone with Android Auto when listening to music. If you use the bluetooth connection (phone unplugged from the Display Audio System), the sound is great, but plugging into the phone into the car's Display Audio system causes a degrading of the sound quality. Several other phones I have didn't cause this, including a Nexus 6P and Google Pixel XL and Samsung S8+. For this reason I returned the phone.",Postif
"Stay away, phone is useless when you have Bluetooth on.",Negatif
"Didn't hate this model. But bought as an upgrade from HONOR 6X (which is GREAT) but despite the additional RAM it was super slow. Basic low graphic games would delay. Over all, sound not as good as 6X nor photo (but I am not big on sound or pictures)
WANTED TO LOVE. Had to return just because of such terrible lag throughout.

To be fair: I may have unknowingly download an app with a malware or something to make such a powerful phone so slow. Sad, but HAPPY BACK ON HONOR 6X",Postif
"This is it, this is the phone you want to buy if your budget is less than $500. At half of that cost too. I always bought flagships, from Samsungs to HTC to Apple. I am switching to this phone from an iPhone X mainly because I wanted to sell it off before the next batch of iPhones were released, and also just because I missed Android. This phone is not a flagship and while you must keep in mind that this costs 4x less than most flagships, it does so well and I have little experience with budget phones that I can't help but compare it to them. I'm a week in and am so blown away by this phone that I figured it deserved a review. I do a lot of navigation for work, play Pokemon Go, and just normal social media from my phone.
Battery life - While it is not a two day battery life like some people claim, it is better than anything else I have used besides the Samsung Note devices. Normally I plug in when using Google Maps but decided against it just to test. After a full day at 50% brightness, waking up early and going to bed around 11, I was left with 10%. I had done around 3 hours of screen on navigation, around two hours of Pokemon Go, and around two hours of social media throughout the day. Very impressed. Should be noted that when I used the dual sim feature, the battery seemed to die a lot quicker and I was needing to charge by around 7.
Software - Running Huaweis own UI was the biggest concern of mine. I had almost went with a Nokia 6.1 because of the stock Android. It performed better than I could've imagined and I experience no slowdown at all, everything feels very snappy and I've only seen a couple lags on apps that seem to lag no matter the phone. Upgrade-able to Android 8.0 out of the box, time will tell if we get any more updates.
Design - Definitely nice feeling in the hand, I used the included case out of the box. Looks to be inspired my iPhone and while it is a good looking phone, I don't appreciate the branding on both the front and back. Although it is helpful as I had to check about 7 times to remember how to spell Huawei.
Display - A much nicer display then I thought would be possible on a device of this cost. Besides the blacks, I really can't tell a difference in this display and any from Apple or Samsung, definitely can't tell which is sharper but that may just be me. It does not get as bright as other phones, but I never use full brightness anyway.
Connectivity - Amazingly this was faster than both my iPhone X and my Galaxy S7. I am on the T-Mobile network and get around 50 mbps speed compared to the 37 on S7 and abysmal 13-20 on iPhone. GPS never has problems finding where I am and it reconnects very quickly. I don't use enough bluetooth to make a fair opinion but I will point out that some other reviews are correct. While on WiFi if you connect to a bluetooth device, my connection dropped by about 15 mbps. Not a big deal when it's 55 down to 40 in my case because it's still plenty fast but beware if you have a slower connection and use both a lot. I only use bluetooth in the car so it doesn't affect me. Oh this is a phone right? Call quality is decent. Nothing mind blowingly clear or really any difference from other decent phones. It also does not support 5ghz WiFi which is disappointing but not a deal breaker.
Camera - The part where most budget phones cut their corners. The camera is good. Better than most budget phones but not even close to any flagships. Low light isn't very good and it takes awhile to focus sometimes. Usually it gets the job done but this is probably the weakest point in the phone. Pictures can still look great provided you have proper lighting though. Front camera also gets the job done but a little washed out. I don't take selfies so again, not a deal breaker.
Value - Just buy it. I guarantee this phone will make you question why there are $1000+ smartphones. If you need a nicer camera on a phone I doubt you will find it on anything less than $600 though. It's a $230 phone that does 95% of everything phones 2,3,4x its cost will do. Plus you get a headphone jack, micro sd card or dual sim, there's also a case in the box. No headphones though. Extremely happy with this purchase and will update if anything changes.",Postif
"UPDATE 07-23-18: So it's taken a little bit, but I ran across a setting on the phone that I've not seen on other Android devices that could help a lot of folks out there especially when it comes to battery management. If you've done any sort of deep dive into this or other Huawei phones, you've undoubtedly come across their great battery life but also the fact that some apps don't behave as well or give out weird notifications. Let's keep this simple: Android operating systems let apps run after you open them until you make them stop running (by selecting all previously open apps and clearing them). EMUI skips all that nonsense by pretty much shutting everything down once you finish with it (or sometime soon thereafter). Great for battery, but bad for things like say something that relies on geofencing (yes Arlo, I'm talking about you). But there is a very simple workaround.

To get an app working and to have it continue to work (like the caller ID app HiYa) here's what you do. Go to Settings and then to Apps and Notifications. Select Apps. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE APP PAGE you'll see ANOTHER Settings icon. Click on it. Now select Special Access and then Exempt from Battery Optimization. Your final step: click were it says Allowed and select All Apps. Once that is done, find the app you want to exclude from battery optimization, select it, and then select Allow (may drain your battery more quickly).

Selecting a few of these shouldn't have an adverse affect on you battery, just don't go crazy and select everything. Good ones to have selected besides HiYa: Visual Voicemail, Dropbox, and Wear OS. Hope this helps!

UPDATE 05-18-18: About a week ago I started to get this error when checking on one of my apps: Google Play Services Are Updating. From what I've read, the problem seems to be confined to Huawei and Honor handsets (and one has to wonder if it's because of the recent update to EMUI 8.0 and Oreo 8.0). The fix is easy - navigate to Settings and then to Apps & Notifications, Apps again and then find Google Play Services. Once you tap on the app, go to Storage and then hit ""Clear Cache"". Once that is done, finish it off by going to ""Manage Space"" and then ""Clear All Data."" If you were getting the Google Play Services Are Updating error, it should be cleared. My error was coming through the Arlo app- others reported they were having problems with Google Maps and Uber (or any app that relies on Google Maps for location).

UPDATE 05-17-18: Phone recently received Oreo 8.0 and EMUI 8.0 update about a week ago. Phone seems a little faster and still pretty bulletproof. I mentioned Arlo app problems- turned out Arlo was having a little Android/server meltdown a few weeks back (that has straightened itself out). One tip: make sure under geo-fencing you have your home address typed into the address box (the app decided my phone wanted to be in Madagascar - if only...). Wireless adapter still works but will still do the annoying reset ping over and over randomly. Full screen problem seems to have disappeared with the update (or maybe I just finally set all of the apps to fs every time they asked). Still liking the phone and recommending it to anyone in the market for a new handset.

ORIGINAL POSTING: :If youre in the market for a new Android smartphone you have a multitude of choices. I recently started having problems with my Galaxy Note Edge (a one-time Samsung flagship) but given that the phone lasted way past its two-year mark, Id say I got my moneys worth.

The biggest factor in my decision making for getting the Huawei Mate Special Edition (SE) was price. Its hard to swallow paying upwards of $800 to $1,000 for a smartphone thats one drop away from becoming the worst thing to happen to you all week/month/year. On the other hand, after experimenting with lower-end budget phones (ZTE Maven and Moto G4), I learned that at least with Android, you do get what you pay for.

Im going to start with something a little different from most other reviews: apps I had to replace. Specifically, there were three stock apps that were tripping me up on the Huawei, because they wouldnt do certain things. I found free replacements for them on the Play Store and Ive had no problems since the switchovers.

 First the browser: Chrome on the Mate SE is slow and full of ads. I ditched it for (of all things) Samsungs Internet browser coupled with two extensions for ad blocking (Adblock Fast and Disconnect for Samsung Internet). Much faster and you have the advantage of a home screen of web shortcuts you can create inside the app.

 Next, the music player. For some odd reason, Huaweis music player doesnt read pre-made m3u files (these are files for playlists). You can make one on the phone, but if you have ones that were made on a computer, the phone wont recognize them. Solve it by installing another music player (I used Pi Music Player and it works just fine).

 As for the camera, the dual back facing cameras are pretty capable right out of the box (you will want to play with the photo and video settings to get high quality pictures). But there is one software/app problem that doesnt affect everyone but will affect some: in video mode, the camera wont recognize an external microphone. Most smartphones can handle a TRRS microphone (4 poles and three black rings) ; the stock camera app on this phone can't. Solution: download a different camera app. I used Open Camera; to get it to work, in video settings, set the microphone to use external mic when present and you should be good to go.

Now the good stuff.

Is the Huawei Mate SE a good substitute for a Galaxy Note Edge? Yes. Is it as perfect as the Note Edge was in its hey-day? Nope. Am I much happier with a new Huawei than a three-year old Samsung? Definitely.

So lets start with whats missing.

Theres no NFC, no 5G wi-fi, no removable battery and of course, no S-Pen. The Mate SE also has a bottom firing speaker that while loud, is kind of weird the first few times you listen to it. Screen resolution on the Mate SE is not as bright and crisp as the Note Edges Super AMOLED display (but after a few days youll get used to it).

What will you NOT get with the Mate SE that youll get on other smartphones (some priced the same, some more expensive)?

 No USB-C- Not a deal breaker for me b/c I have a ton of Micro USB chargers and cables lying around (so its actually a plus right now).

 No Android 8.0 Oreo- The Mate SE ships with Android 7.0 (Nougat) but since the Mate SEs sister phone the Honor 7x is now going through beta testing with 8.0, Oreo is probably in the Mates very near future.

So what is there to like?

 Battery life. I run the same exact apps (plus the three substitutes I mentioned) on my Huawei as I did on the Galaxy Note Edge. At the end of the day, the Edge was at about 15% but the Mate SE is at about 50%. The Mate SE has a 3340mAh battery; the Note Edge a 3000mAh battery. Size-wise, its not a big difference, but the phone, the processor, and the 7.0 OS versus the 6.0 OS on the Note is obviously much more efficient. Advantage Huawei.

 The fingerprint sensor. THIS THING WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. Ive used a fingerprint sensor before, but I found it finicky and slow. Not so here: the Mate SEs sensor is super, super, SUPER fast. Touch it, and youre in.

 Landscape mode: This is odd- on my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge I could never get the phone to do a decent landscape mode on the home pages. Inside an app, no problem, but on the home screens, it never worked. This phone does landscape on all pages. Its a little thing, but after missing it for so long, its kind of cool.

Cool Stuff Ive not seen before since my last new smartphone three years ago:

 IP67 dust or water resistance (originally I didn't think it had it, but apparently it's on the spec sheet).

 Screenshot scroll. Youve probably done a screenshot before, but what happens when you want to get an entire page as a screenshot that is longer than what you can see on the screen? Screenshot scroll takes care of that: its built-in software that will copy an entire page not just what is displayed on the phone (find it in drop down navigation menu). A regular screenshot is just a tap on the navigation button as well (instead of remembering a combo of volume up and power keys).

 Speaking of the drop down navigation menu, Huawei gives you the ability to add a fourth button for that navigation menu at the bottom of your display. You can program the fingerprint sensor to perform a task by sliding your finger across the sensor (like say opening the camera), blocked numbers can be based on keywords and contacts, and Huawei has a virus scanner baked into the phone under the phone manager app.

 Other goodies: you can encrypt photos and videos as well as lock certain apps so that you (and your fingerprint and nobody else) can use the app. Finally, theres App Twin- the ability to log into the same app using two different accounts at the same time. two different logins on the same app at the same time.

My last comments: troubleshooting some apps and things.

 If you happen to use Waze with Android Auto, youre going to have problems with the Mate SE the first time you try it. The fix: go to settings, go to apps, select Android Auto, delete all data including the cache, start Android Auto BEFORE you connect it to the car and go through the permissions. Once done, connect it to the car and you should be good to go. Dont ask, all I know is it worked for me.

 I still havent properly figured out why the phone and Wear OS (for smartwatches) isnt perfect (I had to reboot and start over several times to get watch faces to download.

 If you miss wireless Qi charging from your old phone (or you want to add it to this one), buy a wireless adapter. I modified my old Note Edge to do wireless charging using an internal wirless pad; I did the same with the Mate SE using one that plugs into the bottom of the phone (search for a ""narrow side up"" Nillkin Magic Tag Qi Wireless Charger). It's about 12 bucks- worth the investment. The only drawback with mine: the Huawei Mate SE ""cycles"" through a bunch of charges. What I mean by cycle is it will charge, the screen will light up, and the phone will beep. That's normal when you start to charge, but it kept doing this over and over again about every 30 seconds or up to 2 minutes or so between cycles. Strangely sometimes it does it, sometimes it doesn't. I finally just loaded an old schedule setter app that turns the ringtone to zero each night and back to 100 in the AM in place of Do Not Disturb.

Ill finish with this: the dumbest thing about this phone (and the nicest!) is the 18x9 display. On most apps it works perfectly fine. On some, a dialogue box pops up asking if you want to go full screen. My answer is always yes and when I hit it, it makes you sometimes start all over again. Huawei- please fix this! Its the one annoying aspect of your phone that there doesnt seem to be a quick fix for.

Conclusion: if you need a new phone, buy this one. It comes with lots of memory (64GB built in) and lots of operating RAM (4GB). You can pop in a big SD Card (I have a 128GB) or another SIM if you want to go dual-SIM. Is it going to be as good as a flagship phone? No. But are you getting $600-$700 more umph in a Note 8, S9, iPhone 8 or iPhone X than you would in a Mate SE? Thats for you to decide.

Do not buy any more",Negatif
"This review is way overdue, however I wanted to give myself time to use the phone and get used to its features so I have good information regarding its good qualities and bad ones as well. Fist of oll i am coming from the flagship world of LG and OnePlus phones. I've had the OnePlus One, X, and OP2. Also from the LG Family i've had all of the G Series phones from the G2 all the way through the G6 as well as all V-series phones, V10 and V20, .except the V30. In actuality it was the Huawei Mate SE that Drew me away from the V30 Purchase that I was about to make.The Good/Excellent Qualities of this phone. Actually there is nothing good about this phone.... The things that you like about this phone, are GREAT!!!!
Battery Life: I will go through 1complete day of heavy use (heavy video 3hrs and audio 2hrs streaming) plus regular internet and app (instagram and email) use. no gaming, and still have 15 - 20% battery life by the time i'm going to bed. So Battery life for me is outstanding and it does come with a quick charge feature as long as you use a qualcomm or compatible quick charge device.
Screen Resolution_ Outstanding. Pictures are crisp and colorful and the the stock UI comes with enough options to adjust color and hue to your liking. Also direct sunlight viewing is outstanding with no visible loss in color or shading. Love it!
Processing Speed without a doubt is excellent. Just as fast as any Flagship phone i've ever used. I multi task quite a bit (also come s with a split screen mode which i use frequently to fact check or look up items that I watch on youtube or shopping) and this phone handles everything that I do and more.
WIFI and Bluetooth - comes with an outstanding wifi radio which gets excellent reception from wifi transmitters that you may have problems with on other devices. Also the Bluetooth radio is excellent as well. more of a typical experience but non problematic as most Bluetooth setups are.
Form Factor: its lightweight and thin. very similar to an iphone 7+ or maybe a samsung glaxy 8+
finger print reader: Outstanding. quicker than an LG phone by noticeable lengths. and very reliable.

the not so great or just good::
bluetooth connectivity. I was having difficulties connecting the bluetooth after 3 days of continuous use withouth shutting the phone off. Ive found that shutting the phone off every 2 days alleviates the problem. however now Ive set the phone sho shut off and turn back on at 545-550 in the morning and now i don't even have to touch the phone. my bluetooth now connects flawlessly evry time i enable it.
The camera is good. i can take good quality pics with this phone in normal to medium/low light levels. I take hundreds of photos weekly and i am not disappointed in its capabilities. i've had better but for what you get with this phone, it heavily outweighs the camera inabilities
Lack of USB C..... Okay, this was a big one for me. as all of my newer phones from OnePlus2 to my LG G6 and V20 have had USB type C. It was hard switching back to micro usb and i notice the micro chargers are more susceptible to the ends bending where USB type C are more rigid. But for 239 dollars, it was worth the trade off but to be honest its a livable condition considering the high quality of the phone and the price.

In closing this phone dwarfs the LG G6 and V20 in functionality (ie.UI, and performance) and comes with a dual sim Tray, one of which can be used for expandable memory up to 256GB. but with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of available memory, you probably won't need it.,

Thats it! Honestly, the phone is amazing overall and i Highly recommend buying the Mate SE over the 7X as the added memory and processing speed are worth the extra 30-40 dollars you'll spend.on the phone. As long as Huawei keeps making high quality phones in this price range, i don't ever think i'll buy another 500-1000 dollar phone every again!.",Postif
Only one day so far used this. Disappointed as there was no pin or headphone in the package. Will provide final review after 20 days.,Postif
"Very good value smartphone considering it's relatively low price point. My only complaints are that the camera quality is not as nice as my old MotoX, the external speakers leave a lot to be desired (volume is very low even when set on max, especially if you have a phone case), and the fingerprint sensor is a bit finicky sometimes. The phone also comes with a lot of bloatware apps, which I disabled upon setting up. The battery life is amazing compared to my old MotoX though. I can use it all day browsing the internet and it will still have plenty of power at the end of the day. I also snowboard in the winter and even in single digits temperatures the phone stays on and holds its charge. Just make sure you check with your phone carrier if this phone is compatible first. This model works perfectly on the AT&T network. However it is not fully compatible with T-Mobile - as per their tech Dept, the Mate SE is 100% compatible on the data network, but only 50% compatible on the calls/texts, so that is something you will want to keep in mind.",Postif
"Great mid range smartphone with 64 gb of internal memory and 4 GB of RAM. The phone is well built, and has a solid feel to it. The camera, while not on par with the highest end Apple or Samsung Galaxy phones, is great in good light situations. I normally use the phone heavily, with streaming satellite radio at work while surfing the web and maybe playing a game. The ram in this thing means that everything runs smoothly. I have not had one problem with this phone. In fact, I bought a second one for my wife and she loves hers also. Two of these phones cost less than one of the even last generation Iphones or galaxies. Octa core processor, 64 GB of memory, 4 GB of ram, all at a great price.",Postif
"I am using this on the metro pcs network. I am upgrading from the ZTE Zmax Pro and have to say this phone is a massive upgrade. There is nothing you can complain about here:

+Bright crisp display. 24bit, 1080p,5.93in,ips,18:9,gorilla glass. Awesome colors with deep inky blacks.
+Fast Processor: 2.3ghz octa-core processor
+Memory: Whopping 4gb Ram+64gb onboard storage! Micro sd expandable up to 256gb
+Camera: 8MP front camera combined with a dual 16MP rear. Takes quick very clean photos
+Software: Updated to Android Oreo. Stock phone has minimal bloatware. Useful preinstalled apps
+Unlocked: GSM network
Bottom line if this phone had Apple or Samsung pained on the front the price would be $499 minimum. I can't say enough how much value this phone offers. Fantastic phone!",Postif
"I purchased my Huawei mate se because I wanted something that had more memory
and ram. After ordering it it was delivered on time and there was nothing defective inside or outside of the shipping box. After setting the phone up it quickly updated to the most recent update Android 8. The phone is very quick has a picture quality that is just amazing. I tested it using Bluetooth, mirror share and wifi didn't have one problem with connection. I use at&t as does most my family and they received 3 bars of signal while my mate se is getting full 4G LTE signal
Awesome phone! I'll be purchasing another one for a back up without a doubt. For those of you that are wanting a really good phone get this one trust me at the price we're the ones benefitting.",Postif
"It's a pretty buggy phone. Overall it's okay for the price but I wouldn't compare it to any flagship phones. I had HTC M8 before for a very long time and it served me well. In some ways it still beats this Huawei SE.

Things that stand out to me after a couple of months are: camera quality is lacking; vibrate mode is barely noticeable and I miss a lot of calls because I can't feel it buzzing; speakers are okay and it's not as loud as my old phone, sometimes it's hard to hear people even on max; no extra storage slot; bluetooth doesn't work with Apple products; Huawei suit is not available in Apple store so I don't even know how to transfer files at this point, useless; virtual keyboard could be better; tap to zoom works in a weird way, especially in games; some other things I can't think of right now.

It's an okay phone, like it's good but it's okay. It's a 3 star phone that is nothing special or mindblowing. It's buggy and while I am writing this review, the phone asked me to pair my Apple... when I turned off bluetooth on the phone and my Mac 5 minutes ago. It's the little things like that...",Postif
"Been using this awesome phone now for a week. I will list the pro's and con's of the phone.
Pros:
64 GB of internal storage. That is a ton of space for apps you can put on the phone. Pictures and videos also if you don't have a microSD card. Love it.
MicroSD card slot. I put in my MicroSD card and for the first time a smart phone that didn't ask to reformat the card and lose all your pictures. That is pretty awesome.
Kirin 659 CPU is fast! Octa Core CPU running 4 cores at 2.36 GHZ and 4 Cores at 1.7 GHZ. Every app opens really fast.
4 GB of RAM. I have had up to 20+ apps open at the same time and still had 2 GB free of RAM. No slow down with many apps open with more RAM to spare to open up a bunch more apps.
Phone running Nougat 7 Android OS and I heard that Oreo 8 Android will be rolling out to the phone next month in May. That was a big selling point to me to get the latest Android. When I set up my phone it had a update for EMUI and also updated to the latest security updates released by Google Android.
Antivirus protection already on the phone out of the box. Avast security is running on the phone! Pretty good antivirus program and didn't have to pay for the antivirus program. Always a plus. I found this by looking through all the settings on the phone.
The one speaker sounds pretty good while on the speaker phone or listening to music. Wish it had 2 speakers.
I easily connected to my Bluetooth Headset and Bluetooth on my car stereo which sounds really good.
The Camera has alot of settings you can change and takes pretty good pictures.
For $229 this phone works great.
Cons:
The only con I find in this phone is wish the battery was bigger. At least a 4000 MAH battery. However I browse the web, check work and personal email, Facebook, google +, listen to Pandora internet radio all day, text, make phone calls, access other apps and still have some battery life at the end of the night before I go to bed. I have always felt that smartphone batteries could be better/bigger but this battery on this phone does its job.",Postif
"I purchased this phone from Amazon. It's everything that the video reviewers and people say it is. I could find no fault in it. I ended up returning it though because for me coming from a Samsung Galaxy S4 I just found the phone to be to a bit too bit. It's more than 1/2 inch longer than the Galaxy S4 and it's also a bit wider. After just a few days, I found my hands a bit tired of holding the phone as it's also heavier and tired because of the slightly more reach in order to text with it quickly.

I want to emphasize this really is a great phone for the price. Best I have seen but keep in mind when you're purchasing a new phone than form factor is something you should also think about.

After having this phone, I have to say that Huawei makes a great product.",Postif
"Why spend $1000 on a phone when this $230 phone does most of what you need? The display is edge to edge (left to right), the body is unibody aluminum, the fit and finish is great, the fingerprint reader is amazingly fast, and the performance is really fast. They also give you a free clear case that fits well. I have the Huawei noise canceling earbuds, but they don't charge via the phone headphone jack, like it does on older Huawei phones. I am not a power user of a phone, but I am impressed with the Huawei quality/performance for the price. Setup is easy, you run a Huawei cloning app on your old phone, and it transfers data and apps to the new phone vis Bluetooth. Compared to aluminum iPhone, the antenna lines on the back look much nicer, and the blend into the case much better.",Postif
"I've had the phone for several months and so far it has been great. I'm using a Samsung Fast charger which I feel has made the charging faster compared to the standard charger. The phone is a little larger than what I'd like but the screen real estate is fantastic! The screen is durable but I would recommend a screen protector.

This phone isn't like the flagship phones in which some features you are used to may not work as well on this phone, although they are being updated often. One thing is if you have more than 1 bluetooth device connected it cannot figure out which one to use. This is being fixed with Android Oreo which is being pushed in the next month.

If you're looking for accessories, look for Honor 7x instead of the Huawei Mate SE. This will make things much easier and at times cheaper too. They are the same phone just rebranded for the US markets for some reason.

I've refereed this phone to others and I will not be buying a $800 phone again.",Postif
"I deleted my original review because this phone doesn't deserve any negative reviews. I had reviewed on my opinion after a quick open startup and shut down....without actually really putting any kind of use to base my opinion on because although it says 5.9"" I was a little frustrated as it's actually smaller then my Note 4 and I bought this to replace my aging Samsung Note 4 and after I gave a mediocre review last night my Note gave out this morning just unresponsive. I had printed the return labels and was sending back.

Well to my surprise this phone turns out to be the best phone I have ever had, just amazing.
The display is so crisp, the audio is pretty solid, the CAMERA! The camera is out of this world, my wife who uses her S6 to take pictures of everything and anything just fell in love with it so we are buying another one for her. I uploaded a few pics of random things. It's running Android 7.0 flawless, I have TMobile and all I did was put my sim in and I have signal where I couldn't even get 2 cans and a string to work. As fast the gov telling us to not buy this phone...... Yeah, I found no malware so far so I'm not worried.
Updating:
I want to add this in, screen is actually 5.7"" I installed cpuz to get the true specs because although they advertise 5.9 something isn't feeling right so review the screen shot.

UPDATE:
Not happy at this moment, I'm getting random pop-up messages/Spam. Which I already had another phone/different mnfg, that did this and it turned out to have viruses in the os. I have a year warranty on this so..... Wish me luck

UPDATE:
Spoke with tech support...... If I can tell them what the pop-up says they could help me..... It's a pop-up for a quick second and disappears, It's not long enough to read what it's saying. But for some reason the flashlight is consuming data??? Can't disable it either.

UPDATE:
Still having problems, tech support wont respond to me emails. I cant tell you what it says it is as soon as i unlock the screen it flashes up and disappears and something is running in the background as my battery is draining fast now when i use to go all day and half the next now its only going 12hrs and i have to plug it in at 20% because at 20% it falls off the cliff and goes dead........ NOPE! Not Amazon ads, NOPE! Nothing i loaded as i have wiped the phone 4X now and it still does it. Do i regret buying this phone..... yes now i do, should have listened.",Negatif
"Great phone! My Nexus 6 wasn't holding a charge. After my husband replaced the battery and did a factory reset, I was still charging it 3 times a day with moderate use. I was waiting for the Moto 6 plus only to learn it would not be released in the US. My tech savvy son recommended the Mate SE. I was surprised by the specs given the price and decided to give it a go. So glad I did! I'm in my 60s and found it very easy to transfer my old phone. G-mail didn't work at first but once all the Google updates were complete, it was perfect. The display is bright, audio clear and the font size is customizable. Pictures are clear and crisp. Most of all, I love that the phone is so light and easy to hold. I usually have 30 percent battery left at the end of the day. I've always had an Android phone and this tops every one of them. Everything about this phone is fast and smooth. Highly recommend!",Postif
For the money it's a pretty decent phone however I feel you can spend an extra 75 bucks and get an essential phone and have a flagship device with much better build quality and just a snappier device,Postif
This is a very good budget phone I was very impressed this was my first Huawei phone. This phone has definitely made me interested in a more expensive Huawei phone. The phone does not stick or give any problems the only negative is the picture quality is average. It's definitely a phone that can do a lot of tasks and I honestly did not miss my high-end phone except for the camera this phone also has excellent battery life. Do not hesitate to purchase.,Postif
"Huawei makes such competitive products, but they just don't last. Before this phone, I owned another of their phones. Unfortunately, the camera stopped working just after the warranty expired. With this phone, I've experienced issues with the camera as well. Both times I've called the company, only to be told that they could not do anything for me, since I was out of warranty. As much as their phones outperform many of their competitors, they do not last long enough to justify buying from them.",Negatif
"Great phone, intuitive operating system, great battery, and vibrant colors. My only complaint is that the speakers aren't the best, but that is a very minor part of the experience. You would think that paying 4x the price of the Mate SE for an iphone x (or whatever absurdly priced phone that will be obsolete in a few months) would get you a phone that is 4x better, but this is far from the truth. Don't buy into the hype, you can get a great phone at a great price and avoid an unnecessary payment plan.",Postif
"Pros- amazing battery life for someone who is constantly on her phone (I charge it once a day or every two days), looks beautiful and I like the feel of the phone. Very good deal , even though I had my doubts. Because of this phone, never again will I go back to Samsung.
Cons- currently have none.",Postif
"Great phone. I bought it for my daughter, now I want one for myself. The camera is great. The only drawback is that it's not compatible with the Straight Talk service. I read where it's compatible with Straight Talk, and that's why I bought it, but it's not. . .so now I'll have to switch providers. . . Or return it. That's the only reason it got 4 stars. . It's not compatible with Straight Talk.",Postif
So glad I took the risk and ordered an unlocked phone and did some research online on the overall reviews of this phone. So far I love it. The clarity is pristine and the functionality is great. It was super easy to just put my SIM card from my Cricket Wireless carrier into this phone and it worked without any difficulty at all whatsoever. This also arrived super quick. Highly recommend.,Postif
"The phone is fantastic, greate screen, excelent memory and speed. The only problem was that I didn't received the earphone, according to Huawei it must include in the box. My order was sent to a PO Box in Miami that forwards the product to Paraguay. When I made the claim to Amazon, they told me that the products sent to intermediaries have noguarantee. I received the box perfectly closed, with the factory seals unvoided.
It is a warning for those who buy through PO boxes, because even if the product comes incorrect or factory failed , we have no guarantee.",Postif
"This is an amazing phone. After being a long time iphone user and recently buying a galaxy note 9 i got this phone for my son. Im really surprised by the quality and similiarity to any other flagship phone for 219.00.

Im seriously considering a future purchase of a hauwei phone over apple,samsung or lg.",Postif
"I only care about the basic of things: Screen quality, picture quality, speed, and battery life. This phone meets all of those. I bought it at $240, but I see it went on sale right after I bought it. It has a good ppi, the camera on the back has been really good quality and the camera on the front is better than any camera on my past phones. It's fairly fast on it's own, but games are a breeze. I don't have it in power-saving mode and the battery lasts all day. The one con is it takes forever to charge, but I just plug it in before I go to sleep.",Postif
I had a Samsung..it was terrible..I had an LG which would get extremely hot ...this Huawei mate se is the best phone I have ever had so far..before I bought it I reviewed it over and over again..then I purchased it and I am a pappy camper...the battery life amazing..only thing I wish it rang louder but thats ok considering this phone mimics the iPhone in some ways with out the price...when I save up I will get an upgrade ..but if this phone keeps working as it is I will stick by it...love this phone...,Postif
"This is one amazing phone! Even if it is just a budget tier phone it works amazingly well. Fast and fluid. Apps run very smooth. In the months I have had it, it has never reset or frozen up. I have this phone and also the honor 7x. I do like this mate se better with the extra power inside. Listen the bottom line is you can get a beautifullly crafted, efficient smartphone for around $ 200 bucks that works like a $400-500 dollar phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone!",Postif
"I have been using a Mate 2 for almost four years and it has been the best phone. I ordered the Mate SE to replace it, and I am very happy with it. Hope it gives me four more years of excellent usage.",Postif
"Update: I have switched from Google Project Fi to Mint Mobile. Now I can receive/send MMS with no problem. I guess it was because of the setting of Project Fi.

This phone overall is good. However I can't receive or send MMS. I am in Hawaii and use Google Project Fi service.
Did some research on Internet and tried the APNs reset, still doesn't work. Sad. :(",Postif
"I owned the Huawei Mate 7 and had a love hate with it. Hardware exceptional. Great performance hindered by terrible software, I vowed I never would again. I owned a Note 5 and a Moto Z since then, but fate decided to smash my moto. After 2 fairly expensive phones I decided to go budget. The sub 250 market isn't that great nowadays, but this little gem popped out at me at best buy. One left in the whole of Chicago, managed to snag last one, and I'm super impressed. Battery life is all day and more, performance is way above 250 dollars worth but don't expect Galaxy levels. Screen is great, software is much much better, but still needs work. But I'm super satisfied for this price. And I can buy 2 more before I approach galaxy prices.

All in all definitely recommend this as a buy.",Postif
"This phone is not worth the trouble. If you want a budget smartphone, you are better off with a Motorola.

Good:
- The camera is decent.

Bad:
- Poor battery life
- EMUI is worse than expected (It is like the software team looked at Android and tried to find ways to ruin it)
- Does not work properly with pebble smartwatches

Fingerprint scanner is excellent! Doesn't heat up during long calls. Battery life is good. Sound is mediocre but can be boosted with volume booster app.
Two things I miss are fast or wireless charging and No NFC.",Postif

Great battery life even playing with the game that uses high resources. Glass screen not the greatest stick with gorilla glass this phone screen cracks much easier. The other major issue is when you're at work can you multimedia So that you'll hear your phone ring if someone calls but not here getting notifications and other stuff. Everything comes through the phone profile so you're going to always hear your games notifications and other stuff. The only way to do fix that is to mute phone but then you'll never hear your phone ring if you really need to. This also only has one speaker so it's not stereo. I had contacted the company and they said that this is there practice on this phone that everything plays through the ringer volume. So you even if you're on the phone and a game or message comes through it will play as if that person has it on their phone in this playing it at that time. Don't get this phone if you keep your phone on at a job and keep the ringer on to hear if an emergency. Because everything plays through the ringer messages games everything",Negatif

All I have to say is the picture does not do it justice and you really have to see it in person. The phone is fantastic and I agree with most other reviews on the internet it is best mid-range phone you can get for $500. Trust me, just get it. I heard Huawei is moving out of the American market, what a shame, damn those dirty politicians.",Postif
"I purchased a brand new device, and immediately upon opening it, I found a scratch on the rear camera lens. Unhappy about that, but the phone is a five star.",Postif

"I HATE THIS PHONE!!! If I had not threw away the box I would have send this piece of a phone back. It is the worse phone I have had in over 10 yrs. Yes I read the reviews and all in all the phone received 4 stars, when only 1 star should have been given. I paid 249.99 and I am very unhappy. I have to buy another phone. The phone is always dropping calls, major problem. When its the only phone you have to use.",Negatif
"I really wanted to like the phone and I did. I was actually so excited the first few days when I got the phone. The camera is great, it looks and feels like a great phone (I just switched from apple and got sick of the terrible service and battery etc). However, it was too good to be true. I've not used androids before and a lot of the apps that I wanted to use were available like whatsapp, fitbit. However, the phone is really slow - I read that it might be because the wifi and bluetooth use the same antenna. I will try it but whatsapp video calling was an absolute nightmare with this phone - constant lag. And I also just learnt today that fitbit is not compatible with Huawei phones due to the some issue with their bluetooth and apple earphones don't work with thhs. So it depends on what you're used to and what you are using your phone for- apps that are fairly common may not work well (if they work at all) with this phone. I'm not sure if I will return it but I can't really afford another iphone. :(.",Negatif
Garbage Huawei customer service.,Negatif

"If you have read my reviews you know that I don't immediately review a new phone, I like to get a good feel for it before I post my opinions for the world.

The Good: Great Phone, Good Build Quality, Big Clear Screen, Good Battery Life, Almost stock Android OS, Plenty of Ram, Fast Enough Processor, and Plenty of Space (plus you can add a MicroSD card for more).

The Neutral: Huawei has been in the news quite a bit recently for all sorts negative things, unless you work in government I wouldn't let that impact your opinion, this is a solid phone.

The Bad: System updates have bricked my phone twice. Once was right after I got the phone (annoying but okay) the second time was last night. Its easy enough to boot into recovery and wipe the phone to get it back up and running (I keep most of my data on micro SD card so data loss isn't an issue) but setting all of my apps back up and getting everything back the way I want it is time consuming. So -2 stars and Im returning it.",Postif
"this phone is great, the screen resolution is not as good as the high end phones, but what do you expect. it's a $200 some what dollar phone, but it match up to the med range phones. purchased it for my nephew and he love it. it runs his game just fine.",Postif
Top phone,Postif
"This phone is fast, comes with plenty of builtin storage, and fingerprint reader is a huge plus but overall I would rate it three stars only as I find it not quite up to par with 3 other awesome Huawei phones I have had in the past. Huawei seems to have cut corners on this one. Now on, I'll have to think twice or may be thrice if I should continue to go with Huawei on my next upgrade. At least I'll be sure to check out reviews thoroughly. Read below to know why.

The most annoying thing about this phone is the touch quality. Clearly touch screen has flakiness near edges. For example, if you write something using the builtin keyboard (I think it is called g-board) you will find that most of the taps to ""backspace"" key would not work. Similarly some other keys as well, such as letter P. The touch quality seems to improve little bit after taking Android 8.x upgrade, and then followed by some system app upgrades (specially related to g-board app) via Google Play, but some flakiness still persists. Well, Huawei may claim that this is not normal and could be an isolated problem with my phone unit only, but hey I own two of these phones (one for me, and one for wife) and both have this same *exact* issue. I even replaced one, and that one also had the same issue. So I know this is a real problem and not isolated one.

Dual Sim is a false advertisement. Although you can have two nano sims installed, but only one of them can be enabled at a time. The one that is enabled will show carrier name, while the other sim would show ""Emergency calls only"". Effectively, you cannot receive calls / sms on both SIMs at a time. Another setback.

Networked apps feature does not work correctly. If I set an app to not work on Mobile Data connection, it would not work on Wifi as well even though it is allowed on Wifi. I typically do not like to allow apps such as WhatsApp to use mobile data connectivity, but due to this bug I cannot keep such apps from using mobile data. This bug also seems to affect System Apps. If Google Play is disallowed over Mobile Data, it would not work on Wifi as well. Very annoying.

Overall three stars. I was expecting better.",Postif
Thank You. I have no complaints,Postif
"Nice and fast. Very good for the price.....But if you or the places you go use 5 GHz routers, your phone simply won't see them.",Postif
"... I got this in a pinch after my son dropped (and killed) his phone while away in college. He loves this phone. It looks great with metal finish, the screen is bright and clear, the sound is good and the pictures it takes are reasonably nice. Best of all it was delivered in a locker at SBU the very next day!",Postif
"I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. My research on this product was it had a larger batter a good battery life, it did not disappoint. She primarily used the phone for calls, text and occasional photo. The battery last for 4 or 5 days. She is very happy. Happy wife happy life ??. We would recommend this product. As for the 4 stars for picture quality i am not sure if is the camera or our ability to use it properly. We have taken some very good pictures and some not so good. We are leaning on we need more practice.",Postif
"I really liked this phone at first. Then I discovered poor Bluetooth quality (connects to my car fine, then disconnects on its own, music playback with stuttering). On day two, it reset all my settings back to default. Then all notifications sounds stopped working, phone went into silent mode on its own. This would be a great budget phone if it wasn't for the problems above. Good reception on T-Mobile though. LTE+ 4g no problem whatsoever. Maybe it's just the phone I got, personally I don't want to deal with exchanges and product support stuff. Back to Huawei it goes.",Postif
"First let me say that I have been using cell phones for the last 2.5 decades and have watched them progress to where they are today.
Over the years, out of a the blue companies (we all know who they are) starting producing phones at MUCH higher price levels and the public bought them which generated MASSIVE profits for those companies.. After all they are selling you phones that cost less then $150 to make for $700 + dollars to you.
I have never been one of those people, I always looked for value however I have A LOT of experience with expensive Apple and Android phones as besides my personal phone (and those in my family) my workplace supplied me with those expensive phones. Quite honestly, except for trying to ""show off"" I never really liked them.

Anyway it allows me to make direct comparisons to our less expensive personal phones and I never knew what the big deal was by owning the expensive ones, except to brag to friends about the most expensive phones someone bought.. To me that is a waste of money and I always knew those people who had those expensive phones never really ""bought"" them and only had them because they made monthly payments, anyone can do that.

Ok on tho the Huawei, our family has 3 cheaper versions on ATT service called the Elate, beautiful phone, cost us $70 each.
I was so impressed with them, I started to look into other offerings from Huawei and read up on the Huawei Mate SE.
I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Huawei phones review at ALL price levels. So I decided to buy myself the a New Huawei Mate SE as a sort of after Christmas present from my wife.

All I can say is WOW, this phone is AMAZING. Fit, finish, construction, beautiful refined feeling that you get with high end phones, yet this one is only around $200. NOT $1000 dollars.
It does everything any phone costing 4 times its price can do and do it with really good battery life.
Now lets get real, of course if your some super gamer/power user who needs a super high speed processor for some reason of course you will want the latest greatest processor at MUCH higher cost and much higher profit for the phone company.
For the average to above average American, they would never notice a difference, same with he camera, great camera, better then expected, is it as good as a $1000 phone? I can not answer that because when I take REALLY serious photos I use a Nikon digital SLR camera. I can tell you, Im not sure which is better, the camera in my work Iphone or this phone, so that is saying a lot.

Anyway, if you are someone who is considering this phone, I can honestly tell you, you cant go wrong. Just do it, I cant see how ANYONE can be disappointed and I see my wife now, holding it in her hand and it wont be long until she retires her other Huawei for another Mate SE. :o)",Postif
"This is the one to get. Price is right. Not looking buy the latest flagship phone. I compared my old iPhone 5 to the Blu Vivo recently and It went terribly. See my Vivo review. 2 Gb ram vivo was no competitions in performance to my iPhone 5. 4 Gb ram Huawei Mate did the trick. Its fast enough and does everything the flagship phones can do at a quarter of the price. No problems connecting to Bluetooth in my car. Im able to move files from my Mate SE to a usb drive with no problems. Big screen, good sound a sturdy build, fast performance, GPS, great camera, and an FM RADIO (a trick iPhones cant do) Ive found my new Daily Driver.",Postif

"Ive had this phone since August .I Love the phone. before I made the purchase I read quite a few reviews.since Im not tech savvy & I only talk & text, look at Facebook very minimal things with the phone I decided to purchase it. I like that I can call Huawei theyve been very helpfull. Now Ive noticed that some pictures Ive taking on vacation are all missing . I have peoples names & phone #s in my contacts that when they call it shows up unknown. Im not understanding this at all. Has anyone else come across this issue. I will be calling Huawei again regarding this issue again.",Postif
"This phone has exceeded my expectations so far. I've only had it for a couple weeks this far but in this short time I have to say this device is amazing for the price. I purchased this phone to replace my beat up and aging iPhone 6 plus. No one can tell it's a budget phone. It looks top of the line and in many ways functions that way as well! It's got a large screen, and it's larger than my iPhones screen. The screen looks amazing and it's full HD. I can't see the pixels at all. The sound is nice and loud too. Much longer than my 6 plus as well. It outperforms my 6 plus in basically every way except the camera. The camera is not bad but it's not on part with an iPhone. It's still a pretty good for a budget phone and will still take pretty good quality pictures. The only real complaint I have is the feedback from the audio jack when connecting to my car's auxillary port. Other than that I have no complaints. The fingerprint scanner is super quick and it's packed with plenty of feature overall. There's no wifi calling, is usb, 5 ghz wifi chip or nfc chip but these are all extra feature that I would expect from a much more expensive phone and nothing that j need by any means. Best $220 I've spent in a while!",Postif
"I've had this for at least a month. I really like it. Since so many parts of phones, etc. are made in China I thought I'd take a chance. It has a lot of things that you can customize as well as features other Android phones didn't have.",Postif
"I had been shopping for new phone since my S5 is already 4 y.o. and I can't seem to decide on which newer Samsung Galaxy I want but then I remembered that my niece back in Asia has this brand and thought, if she can like this phone like any other iphones out there, then it must be that good. So I went looking for reviews here on Amazon, and I'm pretty satisfied by the amount of positive reviews that I decided to buy this the same day, and I never looked back! I mean, why pay for $600+ for a phone when you can have similar product at a fraction of the cost, bought this along with screen protector and case, all came together. And soon realized that I needed to go to Metro PCS for a nano sim card, and it cost me another $27.70 at Metro, but well worth it! If I get 2 yrs out of this phone, I'll be happy but hoping to keep it longer than that. The best part is the 64GB, now I don't even need SD card, plus I can have more room for the apps that I had to give up due to limited memory on my previous S5. The Metro guy who helped me was so impressed by the feel of this phone, he is ready to get his own from Amazon, too!",Postif
I have had nothing but problems with this phone. Spend the extra money and buy a Samsung or Apple. Just a garbage Chinese product...,Negatif
This is my first international phone and I love it. Did my research before I bought it and I am satisfied. I normally would shoot for a Samsung Note but for this price could not resist to try and well worth the purchase.,Postif
Phone is ok reasonable price. I used to use samsung 7 edge. Selfie camera is not good as samsung.,Postif
"This phone is amazing in terms of speed , battery , picture quality etc. For $219, this phone is incredibly better option than Samsung or Apple. They charge you more for their brand name. I am using T Mobile sim card and found no issues with network. One big advantage is the dual SIM card capability. I am very impressed with this phone. Thanks Amazon for selling it and Huawei for selling it at an affordable price.",Postif
"The reason I give 4 stars is that nothing is ever perfect. However, I have few to no complaints with the phone I've had for over 2 years. The Huawei is a very good value for under $300. I'm thinking about upgrading with this offer simply because the value for the upgrade is reasonable. I'm usually very frugal and would avoid doing this, but the value is too tempting for the price. Verizon doesn't accept this phone. I've been with ATT. The phone and provider have provided reliable service in high desert, mountain regions, that are very rural.",Postif

"This phone grabs my attention for three things:

1) The RAM size. You will not experience lag between applications. This is hands down the best RAM available for this price point. This alone will make the purchase worth it.

2) The durability. I am a careless user. I dont believe in taking care of your phone. If you pay this much you should be able to live free from worry. I have dropped this phone so many times on the concrete and the screen has not shattered and the case that it comes with has held this up. I am surprised this phone takes a beating and still looks relatively new.

3) The size. I have small hands and this phone does not feel huge or hard to hold. The Mate Pro was too large of a form factor and this one fits perfect.",Postif

"Did extensive research on the budget smart phones, and no other phone in the high $100 to high $200 range even comes close to the bang-for-the-buck value this phone offers. This is essentially an upgraded Honor 7X, and the extra $30-$50 difference in price for extra RAM and double the storage was definitely worth it. The best value in the next price range ($300 - $400) would be the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, but whether you still consider that to be a budget price range is up to you. Pulled the trigger and bought two Mate SE's, one for me and my wife. The research did not disappoint, we absolutely love these phones, I got the black version, she got the gold. The response of the phone is very snappy, the display is beautiful, and the pics from the dual cameras are great. An upgrade to Oreo O/S was immediately available once I got the phone up and running, so that was fantastic, as well.",Postif
"After using Apple for several year, then switching to Samsung, the bottom line is that I was getting tired of paying over $800 for a cell phone. This is a great phone for the money, but if you use Bluetooth often, you might want to consider something else. I use this Bluetooth with headphones and 3 different cars. The main problems are in the cars. Apps such as Audible regularly skip, slow down, speed up, or just stop. Podcasts do the same thing. I can't even get it to recognize my home stereo to pair it. Even with the WIFI turned off, the Bluetooth is spotty.

The pictures appear good, but are pretty bad in high contrast shots. I took a picture of my daughter's soccer team on a bright sunny day (the best conditions in terms of camera light) and the pictures look like a painting when you zoom in at all. The image just looks way too digitized. For lower contrast and lower light shots, the pictures are great. But high contrast, bright pictures tend to look almost like a bad oil painting when zoomed in.

Update 12/19/18 - After 6 months of use, I find that I am constantly cursing at this phone because of the Bluetooth. It won't go 15 minutes on an audiobook without freezing, skipping, or speeding up. When I'm on a call in the car, it will constantly switch from handset to bluetooth, back to handset, then to bluetooth. This renders is useless for hands free calls. I spend a lot of time in the car and depend on blutooth, so I'm likely going to chalk this one up as a loss and go back to Samsung. It just isn't worth the frustration.",Postif
"Amazing, amazing phone. Same quality as a $1,000 iPhone X for 3/4 of the price. Huawei has a repeat customer in me, as this is my second phone with them and I will continue to buy their phones as long as they're around. 10/10 would recommend to everyone",Postif

"*updated to reflect over 7 months of usage*

Pros:
-large storage
-large screen with great image (until con- screen burn chances!)
-long battery life
-many camera options (*does not mean great results)
-Dual Sim (I don't use but for those who do...)

Cons:
-screenburn after about 8 months
-bloatware
-no 5g Wi-Fi connectivity (other budget phones have this so I think it's a fair comparison)
-sound (tiny speaker--alarms can be a challenge to hear!)
-Bluetooth (constant interruptions and need to reconnect after extended periods of time)
-incompatible with Android Auto
-many apps require you to perform special go arounds for them to work (pill reminder, TrueCaller to name a few)
-camera software takes awkward selfies (weird proportions, unclear)
-no fast charge abilities

Summary:
I purchased this to replace my Moto. I was most hoping for at least a similar experience however while there are some great aspects (screen, battery life) I found there to be many things surprisingly lacking.

But first let me start with the good so this review isn't all gloom! The battery life is amazing, and I do love the screen size and quality. Transferring files was an easy, though long, process (took about 4 hours despite the 2 hour estimated time) to help make my phone switch rather seemless. The phone is responsive and I'm enjoying the large memory--both ROM and RAM.

*note that this phone uses Nano Sim cards so you will possibly need to change your Sim card out if use another size*

Within the first day I was disappointed at the amount of bloatware. Besides some huawei apps you can't remove there are also some Android apps you are stuck with (Gmail being an example). I also found the speaker quality to be highly disappointing. Being on the bottom edge of the phone the sound is rather quiet and doesn't sound as clear as other phones.

Within the first week the disappointments continued. The selfie camera is not really useful--most always blurry and at times the aspect ratio would leave photos distorted. No 5G WiFi I can live with, but I miss having the option to connect to another network. Certain apps are incompatible with Huawei devices and others require you to go in to your settings and follow a series of steps just to get important notifications to work (specifically my pill reminder app, Medisafe, cannot remind me of pills automatically; TrueCaller cannot scan phone calls actively without special changes to settings). Also I have found the alarm app to be unreliable due to the poor, low speaker quality I've have missed several of the-something I have not had a problem with when using other devices.

And within a month of use I was also bummed to find that Android Auto does not work with this-or most all Huawei - phone. Using Bluetooth I had to become used to songs cutting out sporadically for a few seconds and after about 40+ minutes of use the signal would stop completely requiring a reset of Bluetooth on the device.

After 7 months Bluetooth continues to be a disappointment with increases in not connecting to other devices (especially car). Then I was surprised to find it get screen burn- I didn't realize that was still a thing but apparently so. Tried several apps that were to help. Didn't seem to quite work, perhaps over time it'll get better--but the way things are going with this phone it'll probably get worse.

Overall while at first the price point was attractive, as more aspects disappointed me I have come to realize this switch was not a very good one. Can I live with it? I can, and need to, but with other budget phones having many of these features I think this will be the first, and last, huawei phone I purchase. There are definitely better options in this price range out there if you're someone who uses a phone beyond battery life and general practical use.",Negatif
I put my sim in and it went to work. Good color fast just a good phone,Postif
"My husband loves his new phone. He is particularly happy about the large screen, decent camera, and most importantly, the extended battery life. I believe he can go up to 2 days without charging it.",Postif
"Bought this for my daughter whose Oneplus 3T died. She loves the phone. It is quick, very attractive and has excellent specs. The price point is unbeatable. This is one of 7 Huawei/Honor phones my family uses. We are all very happy with them. I don't think you can beat it at this price point.",Postif
"Purchased 2 of these and I can't tell a difference in performance or quality between it or a flagship Samsung Galaxy phone. I'm tired of breaking a phone and getting stuck in payment plans for phones costing as much as a computer. This phone is amazing and I feel like I got a secret awesome phone for an amazing price and no one else knows! Im a huge phone gamer and this phone does not disappoint! The camera is amazing with amazing quality and the fingerprint reader is instant. You will not he disappointed if you get this phone. I slapped straight talk Sims in them and they work great.

Review Update December 2018:
Still using this phone and it's still amazing. No loss of speed, I never reach hitting memory cap, and camera is still superb. There are so many cases in the market for it now im never bored of my phone . I've dropped it several times and I was terrified I'd cracked the screen, but it's in perfect condition . A solid phone!",Postif

"This is our initial take on this purchase after just 1 day, but the other half is extremely happy. The main features for him are: (1) more RAM and storage; (2) faster processor; (3) better screen resolution; (4) easy setup; and (5) auto-detection of resources like WiFi and SD card. The first 3 were a given with this phone vs his OnePlus One. The easy setup was a bit impressive though... as always, it offers to install any apps that your Google account had listed as installed... but it also has an option to clone your data from your old Android phone. To our surprise, after all was installed and it updated to Android 8.0 (Oreo), we tried the camera app... and it notified us that it had already directed photo saves (except burst-mode) to the SD card... the music app automatically found the music on the card without any prompting. The phone also asks to detect when you are home so that it can turn on the WIFI and connect to your home network automagically. OK... cool enough for him.
I wanted him to have this phone for the first 3 reasons and for better coverage, as this phone supports 4 of TMobileUSA's LTE bands (B2, B4, B5, and B12)... though they have recently introduced a 5th band. It also has EMUI 8.0 which are the HuaWei Android interface add-ons which typically include extra battery options and the ability to control certain app permissions in the phone. The build quality seems really good... similar to my Moto G5... yet it looks much better and it feels much more sleek.
Also, the dual rear camera is quite the surprise... it is quite good at taking pictures and it seems to have lots of other options in the HuaWei app... though we will explore other from the GPstore. The larger battery might have been a plus, but until he uses it more I am thinking that the extra RAM, bigger screen and processing power will negate that extra battery life at least a bit...
So far, this is one of the best phones I have ever seen in this price range... USD229 well spent!

Notes: (1) there is now enough space to install all of those pesky apps right on the phone (no SD necessary) leaving the SD for music and pictures if you install one; (2) starting and switching apps are brilliantly quick tasks with the octa-core processor backing the 4G RAM; (3) the screen is large and bright and responsive with loads of pixels (2160x1080) and great for watching things in HD as well...",Postif
"Only an idiot would buy anything costing more than this phone. I have tried the Samsung 9+, IPhone X, and even the Huawei Mate 10. Who are the morons that stick the fingerprint sensor right below the camera lens? What good is that? Touch the sensor and smear the lens.
This is a fantastic phone and it just updated the software to 8. I just put a 256 GB card in it so I can watch Red Dwarf, Green Acres and House on it.
Dear Huawei, I have recommended your phone to megapeople. Not just here on Amazon but person to person, too. I think you might think it appropriate to send me your next gen Mate SE for free!!!!",Postif
